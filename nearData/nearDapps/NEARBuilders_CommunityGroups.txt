Community Groups or Builder Groups are developer centric interest groups on specific NEAR ecosystem verticals dedicated to support projects & developer governance from the ground up, and push protocol standards as [NEPs](https://github.com/near/NEPs), and build open source tooling.

## üìö LEARN ABOUT DEVELOPER GOVERNANCE [neardevgov.org](https://neardevgov.org/)

## üó≥Ô∏è submit an idea in the Developer Governance gigs board a [devgovgigs.near.social](https://devgovgigs.near.social/)

It also gives an opportunity for **developers, technical PMs, and founders** to learn from each other, connect + collaborate, and implement the latest technologies, serving as NEAR developer incubators amongst the respective verticals.&#x20;
