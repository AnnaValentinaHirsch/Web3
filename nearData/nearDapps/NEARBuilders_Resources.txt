# üëã Developer Onboarding

&#x20;There are many places to find information about developing smart contracts and applications on NEAR Protocol. These docs will highlight the most important resources starting with a high level architectural overview of NEAR application development, developing with different languages, developer support, developer communities, integrations, videos to learn async, and existing developer funding avenues.

# üí™ Blockchain Operating System (BOS)

NEAR is the Blockchain Operating System

The Blockchain Operating System (BOS) allows end users to quickly discover the possibilities of Web3 and gives developers the ability to code interfaces in a single environment and then fork components to build faster and more efficiently

## Examples of BOS Viewers

In the recent months there has been a proliferation of BOS Viewers

For all the BOS viewers view the BOS directory widget [https://bos.gg/#/onboarder.near/widget/BOSDirectory](https://bos.gg/#/onboarder.near/widget/BOSDirectory) &#x20;

If you are interested in building your own BOS viewer, join the NEAR Social Developer telegram at [https://nearbuilders.com/tg-social ](https://nearbuilders.com/tg-social)

NEAR OS (decentralized apps) The NEAR ecosystem is transitioning from traditional application development (Web/Mobile OS) hosted by centralized entities (CDNs, servers) to a more anti-fragile tech stack where the frontend of an application is hosted on the NEAR chain itself. Depending on their needs, most NEAR applications can be fully hosted on-chain using a tech stack pioneered by two projects in the ecosystem: NEAR Social and Web4. Core concepts include the storing of frontend code on chain and hosting frontends via gateways. Warning: this is a recent initiative and WIP! NEAR Social - [https://near.social/](https://near.social/) and [https://t.me/NearSocial](https://t.me/NearSocial) Web4 - [https://web4.near.page/](https://web4.near.page/) and [https://t.me/web4near](https://t.me/web4near)

****[**nomicon.io** ](https://nomicon.io/)

Low level protocol documentation. If you are a blockchain engineer interested in contributing to the core protocol, this is your source of truth (e.g. nomicon explains how NEAR implements Merkle Proofs). Also enumerates NEPs and their specifications. I think Pagoda's protocol team has ownership of this.

****[**docs.near.org**](https://docs.near.org/)****

Developer documentation. If you are a web2 or web3 dev interested in learning what NEAR is, and how to implement a dApp, this is your page

Doesn't mention NEPs, but how to implement it (e.g. FT, NFT, and how to make a marketplace).&#x20;

Pagoda's DevRel is DRI

# ü§ù Integrating NEAR into Your Application

{% hint style="info" %}
Many projects coming into the ecosystem are wondering what a NEAR integration looks like. At NEAR we encourage both apps to build native decentralized web applications, but we also have infrastructure that makes it extremely easy to transition Web2 or Web "2.5" applications into Web3 tech.
{% endhint %}

## Sign in with NEAR

* NEAR Wallet Selector [https://github.com/near/wallet-selector](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector)&#x20;

## Onboarding

With Keypom you can onboard users directly to use your application in a frictionless way to named accounts. Deploy your own Rust contracts or work directly with the easy-to-use TypeScript SDK

[https://docs.keypom.xyz/](https://docs.keypom.xyz/)

* Integration into Fiat Gateways
* Trial Accounts
* Onboarding to a DAO
* Funding to For Interacting with Contracts
* Get Refunded the Transaction Cost&#x20;

## Swaps

Say you need to swap from one funible token like USDC into another funible token in order to facilaite things like in-game currencies, DeFi, etc. On the backend you can integrate Refv2 (Ref.finance is NEAR's leading AMM).

{% embed url="https://github.com/ref-finance/ref-sdk" %}

## NFT Reputation

* Soul Bound NFT [https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/393](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/393)&#x20;
  * For token gating access. Example of SBT applications&#x20;

[https://github.com/near-ndc/i-am-human](https://github.com/near-ndc/i-am-human)&#x20;

* Dynamic NFT
  * FewNFar API enables dynamic NFTs, whitelisting, and so much more. Also has the capacity to support projects as an enterprise level Launchpad

## DAO

* Establishing a DAO Treasury  managed by a council&#x20;
  * For supporting on building out a DAO join the DAO builder group or reach out to OnboardDAO.org&#x20;
* Working directly with Sputnik contracts

{% embed url="https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract" %}

## Pay with NEAR

* Add the ability for people to pay with NEAR directly. Ex; tipping, donating, etc
* Example code;

## EVM Integration

* Deploy your Solidity contracts on Aurora mainnet. Work with the rainbow bridge to bridge liquidity over.&#x20;

## Your Own EVM

Build your own public EVM chain on the Aurora Shard on NEAR with Aurora Cloud Silos. Setup your own blockchain with your own validator requirements, choose your gas token, have the rainbow bridge built in, interact with other silos and have the ability to pay for transactions on behalf of users.

## Private Enterprise Blockchain with Calimero

Want to leverage the infrastructure of NEAR without exposing your network to the public blockchain. Well with Calimero Network you can deploy you favorite NEAR dApps, and all your business functions on a private shard and easily deploy to NEAR mainnet if needed.&#x20;

[https://www.calimero.network/](https://www.calimero.network/)&#x20;

## Bootstrapping With BOS

* Leverage the thousands of decentralized front end components to quick-start your application by composing widgets directly on a bOS gateway&#x20;
* Or build your own viewer with your own dependencies for a customized dApp feeling, leveraging the hundreds of developers on NEAR.&#x20;
* Integration the SocialDB into your application by pulling wallet information for followers, post, completed profiles, and all data owned by users on the BOS. For more information on how to build on BOS go to [https://nearbuilders.com/bos](https://nearbuilders.com/bos)

## Onramps

Onramps allow users to go from fiat to native NEAR on the NEAR blockchain to start getting transaction fees to interacting with the chain.

See all the NEAR Onramps Offerings Here

{% content-ref url="onramps.md" %}
[onramps.md](onramps.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Integration Partners

NEAR has companies that can help accelerate your integration. Additionally NEAR Foundation has Dev Shop parters. If you are looking for an introduction for the NF Devshop point of contact reach out to **Code** for an intro.

# üòÉ Why NEAR?

Since inception NEAR has been touted for its technical excellence, unique approach to scalability unlike any other chain, and superior account model leading to some of the best user onboarding experiences. As NEAR is moving into its 3rd year since mainnet, there are over 1000 verified applications across the 3 major categories of crypto: DAOs, DeFi and NFTs. In addition to applications, NEAR has a number of infrastructure projects addressing the growing ecosystem needs in areas such as: private shards and compute ([https://www.calimero.network/](https://www.calimero.network/)), storage ([https://www.onmachina.io/](https://www.onmachina.io/)), wallet interoperability ([https://github.com/near/wallet-selector/](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector/)), core protocol governance ([https://mobile.twitter.com/neardc](https://mobile.twitter.com/neardc)), and more ([https://near.org/](https://near.org/))
