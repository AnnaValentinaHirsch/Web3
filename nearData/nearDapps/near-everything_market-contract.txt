<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

The everything market-contract is an implementation for transfering tokens and facilitating transactions regarding [NEAR](https://nomicon.io) Protocol's [Non-Fungible-Tokens](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/). It interacts with the NFTs created by the [nft-contract](https://github.com/near-everything/nft-contract).
<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Built With

- [![Rust][rust]][rust-url]
- [NEAR][near-url]

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust per the prerequisites in [near-sdk-rs](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs)
- [near-cli](https://github.com/near/near-cli)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/near-everything/market-contract.git
   ```
2. Build the contract (this will create a market.wasm in /out)
   ```sh
   sh ./build.sh
   ```
   

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>
