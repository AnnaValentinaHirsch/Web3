# Heads up!
The wallet roadmap has moved at this new link: https://portal.productboard.com/lnpb6dhpyz225uxhuo74d32p

_Old version below_

# NEAR Wallet public roadmap 

In this repository, you can find the official [NEAR Wallet product roadmap](https://github.com/near/near-wallet-roadmap/projects/1). Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what NEAR Wallet features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Join the discussion over on the [NEAR Governance Forum](https://gov.near.org/), get in touch on Discord via [https://near.chat], or open an issue in the official [NEAR wallet repo](https://github.com/near/near-wallet).

This roadmap repository is for communicating NEAR’s roadmap for the Wallet at the address [https://wallet.near.org]. Existing issues are currently read-only, and we are locking conversations, as we get started. Interaction limits are also in place to ensure issues originate from NEAR. We’re planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself, and we see potential to engage more in discussions about the future of NEAR protocol and products. If you have feedback about this roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through [this thread](#) on the NEAR Governance Forum.

## Guide to the roadmap
Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

* A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.
* A **feature area** that indicates the area of the wallet to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

## Release Phases
Every product or feature goes through a set of release phases, from early testing to general availability.

* **in development**
Feature is actively under software development, and it's visible among the [near-wallet pull requets](https://github.com/near/near-wallet/pulls).

* **alpha:** Primarily for testing and feedback
Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs or support provided.

* **beta:** Publicly available in full or limited capacity
Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.

* **ga:** Generally available to all customers
Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations. Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows:

* **in design:**
Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out how.

* **exploring:**
Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

## Roadmap Stages
The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every feature is added to a particular project board column according to the month in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline. You'll also find an **Exploratory column**, which is used in conjunction with the labels **design** and **exploring** for when no timeframe is yet available.

## Feature Area
* **onboarding:** token holders using NEAR Wallet for the first time
* **ecosystem:** NEAR Wallet interoperability
* **power users:** token holders using NEAR Wallet as their primary application
* **security and compliance:** impacting all users and the reputation of NEAR Wallet

## Submit your Feature Request!
This roadmap is open for proporals! Open a [new issue](https://github.com/near/near-wallet-roadmap/issues/new/choose), use the provided template to put the required information, and inform the wallet team on Discord it is ready for review, using [this near.chat link](https://near.chat).
Expect some discussion and questions and two outcomes:
- the feature is included in the roadmap, straight away
- the feature is not accepted, and put in the last column on the right

If your feature is not accepted, don't delete it! NEAR Wallet team will review them on a quarterly basis, and potentially give a new chance to it!

## Disclaimer
Any statement in this repository that is not purely historical is considered a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements included in this repository are based on information available to NEAR as of the date they are made, and NEAR assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking product roadmap does not represent a commitment, guarantee, obligation or promise to deliver any product or feature, or to deliver any product and feature by any particular date, and is intended to outline the general development plans. Users should not rely on this roadmap to make any purchasing or product decision.
