==================

This app was initialized with [create-near-app]

Quick Start
===========

If you haven't installed dependencies during setup:

    npm install

Build and deploy your contract to TestNet with a temporary dev account:

    npm run deploy

Test your contract:

    npm test

If you have a frontend, run `npm start`. This will run a dev server.

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The smart-contract code lives in the `/contract` folder. See the README there for
   more info. In blockchain apps the smart contract is the "backend" of your app.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/frontend` folder. `/frontend/index.html` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it loads in `/frontend/index.js`,
   this is your entrypoint to learn how the frontend connects to the NEAR blockchain.
3. Test your contract: `npm test`, this will run the tests in `integration-tests` directory.

Deploy
======

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts]. 
When you run `npm run deploy`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a temporary dev account.
When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how:

Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)
-------------------------------------

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `npm install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    npm install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)

Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `near-blank-project.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `near-blank-project.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet

Step 2: deploy the contract
---------------------------

Use the CLI to deploy the contract to TestNet with your account ID.
Replace `PATH_TO_WASM_FILE` with the `wasm` that was generated in `contract` build directory.

    near deploy --accountId near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --wasmFile PATH_TO_WASM_FILE

Step 3: set contract name in your frontend code
-----------------------------------------------

Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet'

Troubleshooting
===============

On Windows, if you're seeing an error containing `EPERM` it may be related to spaces in your path. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/zkat/npx/issues/209) for more details.

# Hello NEAR Contract

The smart contract exposes two methods to enable storing and retrieving a greeting in the NEAR network.

```ts
@NearBindgen({})
class HelloNear {
  greeting: string = "Hello";

  @view // This method is read-only and can be called for free
  get_greeting(): string {
    return this.greeting;
  }

  @call // This method changes the state, for which it cost gas
  set_greeting({ greeting }: { greeting: string }): void {
    // Record a log permanently to the blockchain!
    near.log(`Saving greeting ${greeting}`);
    this.greeting = greeting;
  }
}
```

<br />

# Quickstart

1. Make sure you have installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) >= 16.
2. Install the [`NEAR CLI`](https://github.com/near/near-cli#setup)

<br />

## 1. Build and Deploy the Contract
You can automatically compile and deploy the contract in the NEAR testnet by running:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Once finished, check the `neardev/dev-account` file to find the address in which the contract was deployed:

```bash
cat ./neardev/dev-account
# e.g. dev-1659899566943-21539992274727
```

<br />

## 2. Retrieve the Greeting

`get_greeting` is a read-only method (aka `view` method).

`View` methods can be called for **free** by anyone, even people **without a NEAR account**!

```bash
# Use near-cli to get the greeting
near view <dev-account> get_greeting
```

<br />

## 3. Store a New Greeting
`set_greeting` changes the contract's state, for which it is a `call` method.

`Call` methods can only be invoked using a NEAR account, since the account needs to pay GAS for the transaction.

```bash
# Use near-cli to set a new greeting
near call <dev-account> set_greeting '{"greeting":"howdy"}' --accountId <dev-account>
```

**Tip:** If you would like to call `set_greeting` using your own account, first login into NEAR using:

```bash
# Use near-cli to login your NEAR account
near login
```

and then use the logged account to sign the transaction: `--accountId <your-account>`.
