# Hackoween

This repository holds a small app for browsing the Hack-o-ween Civic Buildathon submissions.

## Getting Started 

To run locally, make sure you have [bos-workspace](https://github.com/sekaiking/bos-workspace) installed.

Then, run the command:

```bash
bw dev
```

This will serve the widgets from `http://127.0.0.1:4040/`.

Go to [everything.dev/flags](https://everything.dev) and paste this value there.

Once set, see the locally served app at [hackoween.near/widget/app](https://everything.dev/hackoween.near/widget/app).

## Contributing

Clone the repository, make some changes, and create a pull request.

Pushes to this repository's main branch automatically deploys to hackoween.near.
