## :wave: Introduction

Although we are accepting applications now, the program will not begin funding until September 1st 2022.  
  
As part of our commitment to always improving the Mintbase + NEAR ecosystem, we offer a comprehensive grants program focused on funding software development and research efforts related to **Mintbase, [MintbaseJS](https://github.com/Mintbase/mintbase-js) and our [GraphQL Indexer API](https://docs.mintbase.io/dev/getting-started)**.

 Thanks to the [Web3 Foundation's Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program) for providing the structural outline for this program.

### Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to apply for a grant. Projects funded through our programs are broad in scope, but our focus lies on strong **technical** projects that add value to the ecosystem.

Projects are be more likely to be accepted if:

- Your application is **rich in technical details** and well-defined.
- It presents a **well-researched** or tested concept, for which you are able to show some prior work.
- You can demonstrate that the project will be **maintained** after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources or an existing business model.
- Your team has **proven experience** with the relevant technologies and/or a strong technical background. You will be asked to provide the GitHub profiles of your team members as part of your application, which we will examine these for past activity and code quality. You can also link to supporting examples on other platforms.
- You can clearly present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet.

Additionally, projects **must** fulfill the following requirements:

- All code produced as part of a grant must be **open-sourced**, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. We prefer Apache 2.0 but GPLv3, MIT or Unlicense are also acceptable.
- Projects may not encourage gambling or illicit activity in any shape or form. 
- Projects cannot have been part of a successful token sale.
- Teams must finish projects that have been awarded a grant before being considred for another.

In addition to the information provided on your application, note that your project will need to comply with our [Guidelines for Milestone Deliverables](docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md). In particular, we require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works. At a minimum, _written_ documentation is required for funding. Tutorials and videos are also helpful to understand your project goals and use cases. 

Please also observe our [Announcement Guidelines](docs/announcement-guidelines.md) for grant-related communications.

Finally, we take licensing and the right of all teams in and outside the ecosystem to be recognised for their work very seriously. Using others' work with no attribution or indication that this was not your own work as part of a milestone delivery **will lead to immediate termination**. Please reach out to us before submitting if you have any doubts on how to comply with a specific license and we'll be happy to help.

We also try to enforce our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and reserve the right to [block users](https://github.blog/2016-04-04-organizations-can-now-block-abusive-users/) if necessary.

### Project Ideas
Not sure where to start? Take a look at [this list of ideas](https://docs.mintbase.io/dev/build-ideas). 

[Requests For Proposals](rfps) (RFPs) represent concrete ideas for projects that we would like to see implemented. Several teams may apply for the same RFP, so even if another team has already applied to implement a certain RFP, we invite you to do the same if you're interested.

Finally, you don't need to start your own project in order to be eligible for a grant. Instead, some teams choose to port existing work to Mintbase, where the pertinent licenses allow, or even to contribute to an existing open-source project. In the latter case, you should check in advance that the maintainers of the project are interested in your contribution, and the acceptance of the milestones will generally be tied to the inclusion of your work in said project. See the [Maintenance Grants section](#hammer_and_wrench-maintenance-grants) for more info.

If you would like feedback on your project idea, feel free to contac us at [grants@mintbase.io](mailto:grants@mintbase.io).

### Support

The scope of our Grants Programs consists of funding and feedback on delivered milestones. This means that we do not provide hands-on support as part of a grant, but if you face specific issues during development, we will do our best and try to direct you to the correct resources. You can find general documentation and more information on Mintbase on the [Mintbase Developer Hub](https://docs.mintbase.io/getting-started), and we encourage you to join the [community](https://t.me/mintdev) in order to get help with specific issues and stay up to date with the most recent developments.

For questions about the grants program itself, see our [FAQ](docs/faq.md#frequently-asked-questions).

### Team

#### Mintbase Grants Committee<!-- omit in toc -->

The committee consists of individuals who know the funding priorities of the Mintbase ecosystem, and is responsible for evaluating grant applications and providing feedback on these.

In cases where a niche expert opinion is desirable, one of the committee members may request such a review.

- [Till](https://github.com/tifrel)
- [Rui Santiago](https://github.com/sainthiago)
- [Luís Freitas](https://github.com/microchipgnu)
- [Ben Ipsen](https://github.com/cif)
- [Nate Geier](https://github.com/nategeier)
- [Maria](https://github.com/mariamneu)
- [Regina](https://github.com/reginamintbase)
- [Carolin](https://github.com/caromintbase)

## :pencil: Process

> **:loudspeaker:** The application process is the same regardless of the [level](#level_slider-levels) being appplied for. 

### 1. Application

   1. [Fork](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program/fork) this repository.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template ([`applications/application-template.md`](applications/application-template.md)). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the [contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mintbase/Grants-Program/main/applications/application-template.md) of the template inside the new one. Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**. In the case of a maintenance application, use the maintenance template ([`maintenance template`](maintenance/maintenance-template.md)) instead. 
   3. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review. Please refer to our [Grant guidelines for most popular grant categories](docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md) and make sure your deliverables present a similar same level of detail. If you're only applying for a smaller grant that only consists of, say, UI work, you don't need to provide as much detail.
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain _one new file_—the Markdown file you created from the template.
   6. You will see a comment template that contains a checklist. You can leave it as is and tick the checkboxes once the pull request has been created. Please read through these items and check all of them.
   7. Sign off on the [terms and conditions](docs/T&Cs.md) presented by the [CLA assistant](https://github.com/claassistantio) bot as a Contributor License Agreement. You might need to reload the pull request to see its comment.

### 2. Application Review

   1. The team can (and usually does) issue comments and request changes on the pull request.
   2. Clarifications and amendments made in the comments _need to be included in the application_. You may address feedback by directly modifying your application and leaving a comment once you're done. Generally, if you don't reply within 2 weeks, the application will be closed due to inactivity, but you're always free to reopen it as long as it hasn't been rejected.
   3. When all requested changes are addressed and the terms and conditions have been signed, someone will mark your application as `ready for review` and share it internally with the rest of the committee.
   4. The application will be accepted and merged as soon as it receives the required number of approvals (see [levels](#level_slider-levels)), or closed after two weeks of inactivity. Unless specified otherwise, the day on which it is accepted will be considered the starting date of the project, and will be used to estimate delivery dates.

### 3. Milestone Delivery and Payment

   1. When you are ready to submit completion for a milestone, please open a PR on that adds `submissions/your_project_milestone_YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Use the [submissions/delivery guidelines.md](./submissions/delivery_guidelines.md) content as the template for your submission documentation.
   2. Contact [grants@mintbase.io](mailto:grants@mintbase.io) with a link to the PR for review for further instructions on invoicing and receiving payment.

### Changes to a Grant after Approval

- Accepted grant applications can be amended at any time. However, this _necessitates a reevaluation by the committee_ and the same number of approvals as an application (according to the [levels](#level_slider-levels)). If your application has been accepted and, during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application. This also applies in case of significant delays.
- If your _delivery schedule_ significantly changes, please also open a pull request with an updated timeline.
- If your deliveries are significantly delayed and we cannot get a hold of you, we will terminate the grant (3 approvals required, regardless of level. If a member of the committee creates the termination PR, only 2 more approvals are required).

## :mailbox_with_mail: Suggest a Project

If you think that we should support the development of certain tools or projects that aren't in the Mintbase [tech stack](https://docs.mintbase.io/dev/getting-started/our-stack), feel free to submit a suggestion using the process described below. We are particularly interested in supporting projects that could be leveraged by other builders in our ecosystem.

**Submit an idea:**

If you have an idea for a project or would like to highlight an area in which you'd like to see teams build, but lack the technical background to create a detailed outline, you're welcome to open an [issue](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program/issues/new). We will review your suggestion and, if necessary, will create an RFP based on it and reach out to teams able to build it.

**Submit an RFP (Request for Proposals):**

Ideas generally have better chances of being implemented if they're presented in a project outline format that can be picked up straight away by a team, so if you have a good concept of the milestones required to bring your project to life, you can follow the process below and directly submit an RFP:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program/fork) this repository.
2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the suggestion template ([`rfps/suggestion-template.md`](rfps/suggestion-template.md)) inside the [`rfps`](rfps) folder. Make sure you create a new file and copy the [contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mintbase/Grants-Program/master/rfps/suggestion-template.md) of the template into the new one, and _do not modify the template file directly._
3. Name the file after your idea: `project_name.md`.
4. Fill out the template with the project details. Please include as many details as possible.
5. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain _one new file_—the Markdown file you created from the template.
6. You will see the same template as for creating an application. Please replace it with [this one](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/rfp_pr_template.md).

## :hammer_and_wrench: Maintenance Grants

Maintenance Grants are yet another idea to get involved with the Mintbase community. If you are a user of an open-source library that has gone out of date, or you simply want to work on small new features/fix bugs in these repos, we can support your contributions via a grant. We are happy to award rolling grants on a monthly basis, as long as the work done within each time period is performed to a quality standard deemed satisfactory by the grant evaluators.

The process of applying for a Maintenance Grant is similar to what was already outlined above, but instead of defining very detailed deliverables for each milestone upfront, we will ask you to specify, where possible:

- The repo(s) that need maintenance
- Outline of why the specific project should continue being supported
- Broad overview of the features/bugs that need development contributions
- An assurance that the current project owners are willing to review/accept your contributions (a note here: if you're fully taking over the project, it would make more sense for the current owners to transfer the repository to your organisation. If you can't get in touch with them, you may, of course, work on a fork)
- Max budget per month

Then, at the end of each month, you will need to provide a comprehensive report of the work done, including the list of issues/bugs/pull requests worked on, time spent on each of these & finally the associated cost. It is quite likely that the time allocation & cost will vary from month to month, depending on the nature of the project you're contributing to. The delivery process and format should follow that of a typical [milestone delivery](./submissions/delivery_guidelines.md), as will the processing of the payment.

Please note that:
- Maintenance grants, as the name suggests, are meant to allow teams/individuals to maintain a certain project, and not to continue its development or implement larger features. Please use the traditional application process for this purpose.
- The 1-month timeframe is just a guideline. If you find it unsuitable for you or the chosen project for any reason, feel free to adjust as seen fit and point this out in your application.
- Please bear in mind that the Grants Committee might be stricter in accepting maintainers when compared to typical grants, mostly selecting for applicants with proven experience in the relevant tech stacks.
- Maintenance Grants are only awarded for fixed timeframes. The requested duration needs to be specified in the application.

## :rocket: Alternative Funding Sources

Some funding sources might be more and some less suitable for your project throughout its various stages. We encourage you to explore alternative funding options listed below. Please note, however, that you should not seek to fund the **same scope of work** from multiple sources and that any team found doing so will have its Mintbase support terminated.

### Treasury

The treasury is a pot of on-chain funds collected through transaction fees, slashing, staking inefficiencies, etc. The funds held in the treasury can be spent on spending proposals. [Mintbase](https://mintbase.io) offer everyone the opportunity to apply for funding via the treasury. See:

- [Mintbase Treasury Account](https://nearblocks.io/address/mintbasegrants.near#transaction)
`mintbasegrants.near`

### Hackathons

From time to time, Mintbase and/or NEAR organise hackathons to promote quick prototyping of Mintbase related ideas. We highly encourage you to participate in these hackathons. Bear in mind, however, that you cannot submit the **same work** for a hackathon and the Grants Program. If you have worked or are planning to work on a project for a hackathon, your grant application should either propose a different set of features or otherwise build on top of your hackathon work. The same applies in reverse, although that will likely be less common.

The best way to find out about upcoming hackathons is by following Mintbase on the various social channels, such as Element or Twitter.

- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Mintbase Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Mintbase Modules

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 8,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Mintbase nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |

# Mintbase Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** the **everything** project
- **Team Name:** everything labs
- **Payment Address:** evrything.near (notice the missing e)
- **Level:** 1

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

the **everything** project, centralizing data for the circular economy.
    
Inconveniences and inefficiencies in secondary product markets are creating wasteful consumer habits and stifling innovation in addressing the climate crisis. The solution is to centralize product data online and to create open source white-label applications, marketplaces, and services that can be adapted and serve as the foundation for an interconnected circular economy.
Check out this diagram [here](https://about.everything.dev/diagram) to see what this looks like. 

Through the **everything** app or any of its derivatives, users can upload "Things" and, when marked public or available for sale, these Things will be minted on chain in order to handle transactions and to maintain a history of ownership.
Then, minted things become available on the **everything** marketplace or any of its derivatives, where users can buy, sell, trade, or transfer their real, tangible assets.

### Project Details

- An overview of the project and it's technical architecture: [Link](https://about.everything.dev/diagram)
- An amatuer Figma of the **everything** app: [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/8cL2PwMBPPj2voOOMu54y9/everything-app-v1)
- The original POC submitted to NEAR Megabuild: [Link](https://devpost.com/software/near-frontier)
- A video showing v0 of the **everything** app: [Link](https://www.instagram.com/reel/ChA8Ic0NaRb/?igshid=ZjA0NjI3M2I=)

**NOTE**:

While fraud and item illegitimacy are real issues when pairing NFTs with real, tangible assets, we need to consider that this project is focusing on secondhand and common products, not luxury goods.
Of course there will be some level of protection, but this is a risk that the user needs to acknowledge and the product is not exactly trying to solve.
Eventually, some sort of distribution network (grass-roots supply chain) could serve as an oracle for verifying things.   

### Ecosystem Fit

A recent study suggests that the secondhand product market has become a global phenomenon and is estimated to more than double by 2026, reaching $82 billion — 3X faster than the global apparel market overall.
However, it is also a very unorganized and disjointed product market: current solutions are not prepared for the mass onboarding of every day objects onto the internet.
1) Thrift stores and small businesses want effective ways to move inventory online without having to maintain listings across multiple different marketplaces. As opposed to Shopify, with everything, they can upload their products and have them not only featured on their own branded site, but automatically listed on the **everything** marketplace.
2) Consumers want a central place where they can search for a product and find the closest and best match, without having to visit multiple marketplaces or visit multiple physical locations.
3) Recycling services want their inflows to be sorted prior to arrival in order to keep down costs.
4) Recycling services want to secure buyers for the recycled materials and consumers want confidence in the sustainability of the products they're buying (the closed loop forming the circular economy).

All of these opportunities need a foundation to build on so things only need to be uploaded once and then can be queried by the many applications, marketplaces, and services individually.

With that said, the **everything** app (and its white-label implementation) features a streamlined process for uploading real, tangible things online. 
The white label implementation can be adapted by anybody for any reason in order to create a personalized application and this application could also need a specific streamlined process for uploading things online.

As long as these applications use the **everything** SDK to upload their things online (which is a necessity for the Thing to be added to the inventory of everything), then Mintbase will be the solution for minting.
    
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?

Outside of the Mintbase/ NEAR ecosystem, there are other projects that are attempting to tokenize real, tangible assets such as [4K Marketplace](https://4k.com/press), but they all focus on real estate or luxury items.
There are also off-chain solutions like [Digimarc](https://www.digimarc.com), but they focus on new products straight from production.

Nobody in any ecosystem is tokenizing common everyday and secondhand items.

## Development Status :open_book:

This project has been an effort since the beginning of the year, starting with [this submission](https://devpost.com/software/near-frontier) into NEAR Megabuild. It has gone through several prototypes and redesigns while the idea has been explored and fine-tuned.
An example of a redesign is [v0](https://www.instagram.com/reel/ChA8Ic0NaRb/?igshid=ZjA0NjI3M2I=) of the everything app which was integrated with NEAR and had a POC marketplace querying from the subgraph.

The team is now building v1-beta of the everything app following the adjustments that have been made since v0.

| 2. | SDK Development: Saving media | We will build functionality that uploads media to a distributed file system (IPFS)  |  
| 3. | SDK Development: Reading private data | We will build functionality that enables developers to read private data from the off chain database   |  

### Milestone 2 Example — SDK Integration with the everything app

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  1.5 (will be actively recruiting contribitors)
- **Costs:** 4,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | MIT |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a developer can clone and adapt the **everything** app for their own specific purpose. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions of the app will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | UI Design  | We will hire a product designer to design the core functionalities of the everything app: User can onboard a Thing, User can upload Media, User can view their Things, User can view other user's public things. (ideally this would start during milestone 1)  |
| 2. | Figma Template | We will provide a Figma template that can be adapted to any purpose relevant to the **everything** app. |
| 1. | SDK Integration: Creating Things  | We will integrate the **everything** SDK into the Thing onboarding functionality. Users can mark a Thing to be public or private. Public things are minted on chain via Mintbase, private things are not. |  
| 2. | SDK Integration: Saving media | We will integrate the **everything** SDK into the media upload functionality during creation of a Thing. Media will be stored on a distributed file system.  |  
| 3. | SDK Integration: Reading private data | We will integrate the **everything** SDK into the users profile so they can read their private data using their access token from the identity provider. Other users will not be able to access this data.  |   
| 4. | Full UI Integration | All SDK developments above have been developed to the **everything** app. Users will be able to create things privately and publicly via the app. If private, then the thing will be saved off-chain only, and if public, then the thing will be saved off-chain as well as minted via Mintbase. Users will be able to upload media attached to these things and this Media will be stored in a distributed file system via the SDK. Users will be able to see their privately uploaded things on their profile. |

-  it shall be a software-based project, which contributes to the advancement of the Mintbase ecosystem;
-  the total amount of funding requested for the project shall be below USD  30,000 and USD 100,000 for follow-up grants at the time of submission;
-  the Software shall be released under the Apache license version 2.0.;
-  You must accept payment in the blockchain tokens native to the Bitcoin Network ("BTCs") or the Ethereum based stablecoin DAI;
-  You will need to submit the application and deliver the milestones according to the process specified below;

The open grants process consists of five parts, each of them described in more detail below:

**(i)  Grant application process:**

To apply for a grant of the Mintbase  Foundation Open Grants Program, You shall comply with the procedures established in the README.md file under <https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program> as well as the process defined inside this document.

To apply for a grant of the Mintbase Open Grants Program, the grantee needs to fork (= create a copy on GitHub of) the Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository. In the newly created fork (=copy on GitHub), the grantee has to create a copy of the application-template.md. The copied application-template.md needs to be renamed as "project_name.md". "Project_name" needs to be replaced with the name of the project application. Additionally, the grantee has to fill out all mandatory parts of the application-template.md presented in bold letters. Once the grantees have completed the application, they need to create a new pull request (= in this case, a mechanism to submit the changes of the fork to the original Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository) by clicking on the "create new pull request" button shown inside the fork of the Mintbase Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository. After this, the grantee needs to sign off the terms and conditions presented via the CLA assistant.

**(ii)  Application review process:**

The Mintbase grants committee, which is specified on the [Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository ](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program)(the "Grants Committee"), can issue comments and request changes on the grant application pull request (the submission of the grant application on GitHub).  As soon as 1/3 of the Grants Committee approves the pull request, the terms and conditions are signed off and all requested changes are addressed, the application is officially accepted. The application is now a part of the [Mintbase Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program). The time point of the acceptance by the Grants Committee is hereby stored on GitHub and counts as the official beginning of the grant. The original submission is stored with a unique commit hash (identifier) and can not be altered by any party. The final version approved by the Grants Committee of the Specifications, the Time Schedule and Milestones will be placed  in the applications folder of the Mintbase Open Grants Program Repository at <https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program/tree/master/applications> via the merge function of GitHub.

**(iii)  Milestone delivery process:**

To submit one of the possible multiple milestones specified in the application, You shall fork the [Grant Milestone Delivery GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery) with the same Github account, used to submit the initial application. In the newly created fork, You shall create a copy of the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md). Such [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md) needs to be renamed as "project_name_milestone_number.md". "Project_name" needs to be replaced with the name of the project application and milestone number with the number of the delivered milestone. Additionally, You shall fill out all mandatory parts of the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md) as well as the invoice form linked inside the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md). Once You have completed the milestone delivery document, You shall create a new pull request by clicking on the "create new pull request" button shown inside their fork of the [Grant Milestone Delivery GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery).

**(iv)  Milestone review process:**

The Grants Evaluators, who are specified on the [Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program), can issue comments and request changes on the milestone delivery pull request. 

a)  Purpose and object of the milestone review process

The purpose of the milestone review process is to examine whether the  Milestones and/or Software meets the requirements agreed in the Specifications. The milestone review process shall take place following the submission of each milestone as specified in the time schedule.

The test criteria that must be met in order for the Milestones and/or Software to be considered as acceptable by Mintbase are determined in the Specifications.

The milestone review process shall be deemed to have been successfully completed if no significant defects are found in any of the Milestones and/or Development Work. Insignificant defects shall not prevent acceptance by Mintbase.

b)  Acceptance Procedure

If any of the Milestones and/or the Software does not meet the test, review or inspection criteria, Mintbase shall grant You a period of 14 days to rectify the defects and any deviations from the Specifications found and objected to during the milestone review process. Rectification shall be free of charge for Mintbase.

If You are unable to remedy the defects within this additional period, You shall be considered to be in default, without any additional notice by Mintbase.

In the event of default, Mintbase may either, at its discretion:

- insist on the rectification of the milestones and/or the Software;
- delegate the completion of the Software to a third party at your expenses;
- reduce payment of the Grant because of the reduced value of the Software; or
- refuse payment of the Grant in full (for the avoidance of doubt, this may require You to refund all milestone and advance payments made under these Terms and Conditions).

As soon as one evaluator approves the pull request, the delivery is officially accepted. The delivery is now a part of the [Grant Milestone Delivery GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery). The time point of the acceptance by the evaluator is hereby stored on GitHub. The original submission is stored with a unique commit hash (identifier) and can not be altered by any party.

**(v)  Payment process:**

The Operations Team specified in the [Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program), gets notified once the above-specified delivery was accepted or after 2 weeks without any feedback after the initial delivery. As soon as any feedback is provided by the evaluators, this feedback first needs to be resolved. After this, the Operations Team makes the payment to the BTC or Ethereum address specified in the initial application.

# Announcement Guidelines

> Guidelines updated April 2022

Mintbase supports many teams and organizations throughout the ecosystem. We often receive requests to participate in project announcements. Unfortunately, due to the high volume of requests, we rarely do joint announcements and do not provide quotes.

In the context of the grants programs, we ask teams not to make any announcements before **the first milestone has been accepted**. This is in order to protect the community from projects that only intend to use the grant announcement to raise funds and/or interest but don't intend to deliver on the application, which has unfortunately happened in the past. For this reason, we reserve the right to terminate grants if this rule is not observed.

Once you have completed your milestone, we can help by reviewing and proofreading your announcement. When you have drafted your announcement send it to [grants@mintbase.io](mailto:grants@mintbase.io). Please allow 1-3 working days where possible for proofreading articles and wait until the milestone has been accepted to publish it.

We also cross-promote the most recent projects and their milestones on Twitter on the second Monday of every month, so please keep us updated and send us the links to your published tweets regarding your announcements.

## We recommend the following guidelines when writing your post

- The post should be strategic in nature, focusing on the tech rather than the "announcement" element.
- The team should point to the work, in order to attract attention for the project and demonstrate momentum in the ecosystem. It should be informative for builders and the larger community.
- The post should include a link to a GitHub repository or elsewhere to showcase what's been built so far.
- Suggested flow for the post:
  - This is what the team has built so far.
  - These are the team's future development plans.
  - This is how the technology will contribute to the Mintbase ecosystem.

## Key components

1. A blog post header image
   - An image helps when sharing the announcement on social networks. It's more prominent in feeds and looks more professional.
   - Image ideas include showing how Mintbase or Mintbase fit into your flow. Or you can simply put the teams' logos next to each other.
2. About your team
   - This is a chance to share more about your project and what it does.
   - You can also highlight additional use cases for this new integration.
3. Why you chose to build on this tech stack
   - Illustrate the rationale for the relationship - why did you decide to work with Mintbase?
   - Describe the benefits of building on Mintbase (shared security, ease of use, ease of deployment, ease of interchain communication, decentralized,
  trusted, etc.) and why it was it important to have these features for your project.
4. Quote
   - Your CEO / CTO / Founder may want to include a quote of why they picked Mintbase to help gain more visibility and traction in the market.
5. Description of Mintbase
   - If you wish to mention Mintbase or Mintbase within the body of your text we recommend the following or similar:
     - "Mintbase funds research and development teams building the
technology stack of the decentralized web. Nate Geier. Mintbase is the Foundation's flagship project."
     - "Mintbase is a scalable sharded chain and the first protocol that provides a secure environment for cross-chain composability across multiple shards. Mintbase also introduces a highly advanced, open governance system that will allow the network to innovate and grow at a much faster pace than legacy networks. Applications from DeFi to energy to gaming will thrive on Mintbase, challenging the centralized platforms of Web 2.0."
6. Social connections
   - The following text regarding Mintbase's social presence can be added at the end of your article: "Learn more about Mintbase by visiting their [website](https://mintbase.io/), and stay up to date with the latest developments by following them on [Medium](https://blog.mintbase.io/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mintbase)."
  
## Recommended language
  
1. Use specific verbs such as integrate, support or build.
2. Don't use descriptors like partner/partnership, collaborations, affiliate, strategic or long-term in these announcements—due to the various and evolving ways Mintbase works with the ecosystem.
3. Don't describe your technology as the "first" to build on Mintbase—timing for launch implementations across all our projects is indefinite.
4. Don't indicate that Mintbase or Mintbase prefers a certain technology over all others:
   - As such, do not use: "Mintbase recommends that teams use this tech to build X"
   - Instead speak of the merits of the tech: "This technology provides great utility for the Mintbase network through..."

We look forward to working with you in creating the next generation of the internet! If you have any questions or would like to be included in our next announcement, please email [grants@mintbase.io](mailto:grants@mintbase.io)

## :clipboard: About

The Mintbase Tech Stack is a subset of the Mintbase Tech Stack, which consists of the **open-source** technologies contributing to and relying on [Mintbase](https://mintbase.io/). It is meant to be used for decentralized application (Dapp) development within numerous verticals including DeFi, Gaming, Provenance and many others not pictured below.

## :battery: Funding

The Mintbase's [Grants Program](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program) is focused on funding development work to build out all layers of the Mintbase Tech Stack. 

To get a better understanding of the projects we consider most relevant, you can explore a detailed breakdown of the various layers of the stack below. We divide each of the layers into the various *components* which we feel are most important. We then highlight some of the *existing projects* that address these components as well as some *potentially interesting projects* that we would like to fund.

We typically like to fund more than one project for each component. So, if you see a component with 1 or 0 existing projects, it's likely that we would consider an application in this area. In order to consider funding a proposal that addresses a component with many existing projects, we would need to be persuaded that yours brings unique value to the ecosystem. Such value could come in many forms including but not limited to differentiated functionality, better user experience, the attraction of new users to the ecosystem or a high likelihood that the technology would be maintained for a long period of time.

By describing our areas of priority in detail, we do not wish to preclude grant applications that address different areas that we may not have thought of. We would like to fund all projects that bring value to the ecosystem. If you are considering applying for a project and are not sure if it falls within our areas of interest, please get in touch with us to discuss it.

## 🧭 General

<details>
  <summary><b>How much can I ask for?</b></summary>

  Please refer to the [section on grant levels in our README](../README.md#level_slider-levels) for funding limits.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What activities/positions do you fund?</b></summary>

  The Mintbase's Grants Program aims to fund software development and research activities that are beneficial for the ecosystem as a whole. As such, we don't usually fund tangential costs such as business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach, and—for non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits. We also expect you to have a good understanding of the technologies you are planning to use, meaning that we don't fund time spent learning how to use Mintbase or how to write ink! smart contracts.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Can anyone apply?</b></summary>

  Projects for which a token sale has been or is being conducted are not eligible for a Mintbase grant. Other than that, there are no restrictions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Can I get an upfront payment?</b></summary>

  No.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>When do I get paid?</b></summary>

  Payments are issued once a milestone has been successfully delivered. By ‘successful’, we mean that our Grants team has reviewed _and officially accepted_ your submission.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Can I reuse someone else’s open-source code?</b></summary>

  Open source software and the Mintbase movement are all about collaboration. As long as you meet the code’s license, we encourage you to find, modify and contribute to already existing libraries and projects if it is of use for your project. However, we expect you to honour other people’s work and their right to attribution, and your published code to adhere to the license requirements of the code you are benefiting from. Submitting code as part of a milestone that violates someone else’s license will result in immediate termination. We will furthermore continue to monitor any repositories you may have submitted as part of a milestone for possible license infringements and reserve the right to terminate the grant if we find you going out of your way to hide external contributions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>I am starting a company that [...]. I want to use Mintbase to build a blockchain/parachain and connect [...]. Would I be eligible for a grant?</b></summary>

  We do not award grants to individual companies developing their private infrastructure. However, if part of your work is to build a library or another piece of software that could be of interest to the general Mintbase ecosystem and ask for funding specific to that, we are happy to look into it.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>My application was rejected. Do you have any recommendations on where to go from here?</b></summary>

  We usually give reasons why an application was rejected. We always try to be constructive and work with you towards an application that is beneficial to all parties. If we find no common ground, please have a look at [this section in our Grants Program readme](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program#rocket-alternative-funding-sources) for a list of alternative funding opportunities.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>One of your grantees is using my code without respecting the terms of its license.</b></summary>

  Please [reach out to us](mailto:grants@mintbase.io) asap.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Why are other grant applications being accepted faster than mine?</b></summary>

  There are many reasons why your application might take longer than others: some applications are straightforward and simple and address an obvious issue, others require deeper understanding and discussion. If your application is highly technical or specialised, we might have to bring in an external evaluator. Sometimes, this specialised evaluator is busy with another evaluation. And sometimes, the committee is simply unsure or not quite convinced.
</details>

## 🖊️ Application Process

<details>
  <summary><b>How long does it take from application to decision?</b></summary>

  Depending on the requested amount, quality of the application and desirability for the ecosystem, a grant application could be approved within a week. Usually, there will be a discussion and requests for changes, additions or improvements. If no one in the committee finds the application approval-worthy or you don't react to our comments, it will be closed after two weeks of inactivity. Very large grants require the approval of the council, which convenes once a month. Thus, once an editor declares your application sufficient, it may take up to one month until a decision is made.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>A Mintbase member approved my application. Does that mean it is accepted?</b></summary>

  Depending on the size of the grant, applications require two to five committee members to approve it. Since we have many different members with different backgrounds and specializations, it is possible that the committee disagrees and your application gets rejected even though one or two members approved it.
  The application is accepted once the pull request is merged.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How do I apply if I want to keep information private or want to be paid in fiat?</b></summary>

  For special cases that do not fit the regular grants structure, we provide [a form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMfjiRmDQDRk-4OhNASM6BAKii7rz_B1jWtbCPkUh6N7M2ww/viewform). You can provide all application data by submitting this form, or submit the form with a reference to a pull request with data you are willing to make public.
</details>

## 🥳 After Approval

<details>
  <summary><b>When can I apply for a follow-up grant?</b></summary>

  Anyone who has successfully completed a grant project (i.e. all milestones were accepted, or the previous grant was terminated in mutual agreement) can apply for a follow-up grant. Concurrent grants are only granted in special circumstances.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Something came up and I cannot finish the project in time. Can we postpone or call off the rest of my project?</b></summary>

  The Mintbase reserves the right to terminate an agreement that is behind schedule. However, we are not interested in taking away your grant for any slight hiccup. More often than not, delays are part of the journey and do not constitute a reason for concern. The best way to handle changes in your plans is to get in touch with us. If you would like to prematurely end your work, we can amend your application and remove the milestones you won't be able to complete. If you decide to continue work at a later date, you can always reapply for the remaining milestones and potentially adapt them to take into account any insights you have gained in the meantime.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Can I list the Mintbase as a partner?</b></summary>

  No. Once the grants team has accepted your first milestone, you may display our [grants badge](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/grant-badge-guidelines.md) in a project-specific context, such as the repository containing the grant project work.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Can you help me advertise my project?</b></summary>

  The Mintbase does not provide PR services to its grantees. However, once per month we co-promote announcements from grants that have delivered a milestone on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mintbasefoundation). Note that the milestone needs to have been accepted prior to the announcement. Lastly, please observe our [announcement guidelines](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/announcement-guidelines.md) for all grant-related communications. This document also lists an email address through which you can get in touch with our PR team for feedback and in case you have specific questions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>I found one of my deliverables to be unnecessary, impossible or already done elsewhere. What do I do?</b></summary>

  Plans change. If you find parts of your original grant application to be unnecessary or you decide to pivot, but you still want to finish the project: get in touch with us. If your new plans are in line with the Mintbase’s values and the council approves the amendment, you can continue your work. If your plans change significantly or you find yourself not being able to finish the grant, we can mutually agree to terminate the grant early. You are always welcome to reapply another time.
</details>

## 🚚 Milestone Delivery

<details>
  <summary><b>How do I submit a milestone?</b></summary>

  For details, please refer to the [milestone delivery guidelines](./milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md) for the respective grants program. Generally speaking, the most important part of a delivery is a list of **the same deliverables listed in the application** with links to their implementation/realisation (ideally pointing to a specific commit or tag, so you can continue working on your repository without messing up your delivery and complicating our evaluation) and any additional notes you might have. The list of deliverables for each of your milestones should be defined in your grant agreement.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Can I submit two or more milestones at once?</b></summary>

  You can. However, we strongly encourage you to submit your work in increments (milestones), so that you can be sure we didn’t misunderstand (an aspect of) your application, and you didn't make changes to your plan or delivery that would have required a reevaluation of the application.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Can I add a badge to my repo once I’ve completed a milestone?</b></summary>

  If yours is a [Level 2 or 3](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program/blob/master/README.md#level_slider-levels) grant and your first milestone has been submitted **and accepted**, yes. Please make sure that you follow the [badge guidelines](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/grant-badge-guidelines.md) when doing so.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Why are other milestones being accepted or discussed faster than mine?</b></summary>

  While we try to process deliveries chronologically, some milestones aren't processed quite as fast as others. One obvious reason is the complexity of the delivery and its evaluation. Other times, your submission might require internal discussion or delegation. In any case, if you have any question on the processing of your delivery, you can reach out to us via email or Github.
</details>

# Milestone Delivery Guidelines

These are the guidelines to be followed for milestones submitted for evaluation.

## Submission

Submission process will be created once the grants program beings July 1st 2022.

## Invoice

Although a milestone needs to be reviewed and accepted, you can already submit your invoice through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform).

## Content

The submission should contain the following information:

- **Name of the grant project**
- **Link to the open-source code/delivery**
- **[License](#license)**
- **[Documentation](#documentation)**
- **[Formatted code](#formatted-code), according to a set of guidelines**
- **[Testing Guide](#testing-guide)**
- **A list of the [milestone deliverables](#milestone-deliverables)**
- **Any [additional information](#additional-information)**

## License

In order to successfully receive grant funding for your application it is necessary for the project to have open source code.
We prefer Apache 2.0, but MIT or Unlicense are also acceptable. If your delivery comprises multiple repositories, make sure to include the license for each of them.

## Documentation

We value high-quality open source code, but even the most performant code is of little use if it lacks proper documentation.

We require that you document (where applicable):

- API calls
- Architecture overview and individual component details
- Algorithms and protocols that are core to your project
- Any other fundamental building blocks to your technology

Unless absolutely necessary, make the documentation public as well, ideally as part of the appropriate code repository. This will make it easier for the community to use or adapt your project.

**Note**: Only focus on your **own** contributions. Do not write detailed explanations of already existing components, e.g. IPFS.

## Formatted code

A codebase that is easy to read is also easy to use. We suggest adopting one style from Day 1 and adhering to it across the entire team.
This helps to keep the commit history clean and facilitates any reviews of the introduced changes.

For **Mintbase**, we strongly recommend formatting your code according to the [official guidelines](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md).

For **Rust**, we encourage formatting any additional support libraries or helpers by following the [Style Guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/README.html).

For **any other** deliveries, please commit to a particular style & let us know which official guidelines you adopt.

## Testing Guide

We require that each milestone delivery includes a comprehensive test suite, consisting of:

### A step-by-step guide demonstrating how your code achieves the milestones

Please provide documentation on how to install, compile, run and test the deliverable(s). Make sure to include all necessary prerequisites. Common issues while replicating test results involve, among others, undocumented dependencies, version numbers, local database setups, breaking changes in the main branch since delivery, OS- and browser-specific incompatibilities.

Depending on the deliverable, this could include (but is not limited to)

- how to embed your library in another application,
- how to make example API calls to your service,
- running your web app, and
- steps to complete some desired action in your mobile app.

### Unit tests

As with any quality software project, each logical code component should be testable.

### Integration tests

We prefer dockerfiles to avoid problems with versions and dependencies.

**Note**: If you are not delivering code as part of your project, such a test suite is not applicable. This mainly applies to projects centering on design, research or hardware. If that is the case, please provide detailed instructions on how else we can test/run/replicate your deliverable.

## Milestone Deliverables

Please provide a list of milestone deliverables. This list should closely reflect the list of deliverables agreed on in the Pull Request for the public **Grants Program** application or in Annex 1 of the grant contract for the private applications.

Each item in the list should include a link to the deliverable itself, e.g.:

- Google Doc link - make sure anyone with the link has View access
- GitHub repository - include the appropriate file/folder in the link

**Please highlight anything that deviates from the contract** and include further information that you think is relevant to the deliverable, either alongside the appropriate deliverable or under [Additional Information](#additional-information).

Please ensure the repo has the correct open-source license.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | https://github.com/.../LICENSE | ... |
| 0b. | Documentation | ... | ... |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | ... | ... |
| 1. | ... | ... | ... |
| 2. | ... | ... | ... |

## Additional Information

Please add any additional comments that you consider relevant for the evaluation.

- https://github.com/<team_member_2>

### Team LinkedIn Profiles (if available)

- https://www.linkedin.com/<person_1>
- https://www.linkedin.com/<person_2>

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/Mintbase/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Mintbase,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Maintenance Responsibilities :nut_and_bolt:

This section should specify what kind of tasks and responsibilities the maintainer team will cover during future development. If you have already outlined a list of issues/bugs or pull requests that need further development - you can specify them here to provide more context on what tasks you will close.

Also, make sure the current project owners are willing to review/accept your contributions (a note here: if you're fully taking over the project, it will make more sense for the current owners to transfer the repository to your organization. If you can't get in touch with them, you may, of course, work on a fork).

Below we provide **example maintenance responsibilities**.

Issues we want to fix:
- There's a bug in the JsonRPC library that affects its speed.
- Massive lack of documentation and part of it is outdated.
- Code has no comments, and it's tough for new developers to understand the code and contribute.

Our responsibilities:
- We will maintain the project's documentation.
- We will answer issues and discussions.
- We will fix new bugs as we receive and help contributors who have pull requests get any needed information.

> ⚠️ *Note that all code should be published under an open-source license during the maintenance period.*

### Overview

- **Start Date:** Date, when you plan to start with the maintenance work. 
- **Sprint/Period Duration:** Duration of the sprint/period (e.g. 4 weeks)
- **Total Duration:** Duration of the entire maintenance contract (e.g. 1 year)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Max budget per sprint/period:** Requested max budget in USD per sprint/period (e.g. 7,000 USD). Cost for each period need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
- **Hourly rate:** Amount of budget per hour, since it’s unlikely that the maintenance of the project requires the exact same workload each sprint. 

> ⚠️ *Note that you will need to provide a comprehensive report of the work done at the end of each month, including the list of issues/bugs/pull requests worked on, time spent on each of these, & finally, the associated cost. The time allocation & price will likely vary from month to month, depending on the nature of the project you're contributing to. The report should be in the form of a Milestone Delivery, again like the typical procedure. Mintbase will make the payments only after the successful merge of each individual report.*

## Future Plans

Please include here

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support the projects in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Maintenance Grants Program?** Mintbase Website / Medium / Twitter / Element / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation / etc.

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

- Work you have already done.
- Whether there are any other teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project.
- Previous grants you may have applied for.

- [:grey_question: What is an RFP?](#grey_question-what-is-an-rfp)
- [:mailbox_with_mail: Suggest an RFP](#mailbox_with_mail-suggest-an-rfp)

## :grey_question: What is an RFP?

An RFP (Request for Proposals) is a declaration of interest for others to submit a grant application regarding a specific project. They usually revolve around issues that the author (often someone from our team, but [anyone can suggest one](/README.md#mailbox_with_mail-suggest-a-project)) deems useful and missing or unsolved in our ecosystem.

If you find an open RFP here that you think you can address, feel free to [submit a grant application](../README.md#1-application). There is a [section in our application template](../applications/application-template.md#project-overview-page_facing_up) where you can reference the RFP you are addressing.

## :mailbox_with_mail: Suggest an RFP

If you think that we should support the development of certain tools or projects (related to **Mintbase or NEAR**) that aren't in the Mintbase / NEAR, please submit a suggestion using the process described in our [Grants program README](../README.md#mailbox_with_mail-suggest-a-project). We are particularly interested in supporting projects that could be leveraged by other builders in our ecosystem.

## License

In order to successfully receive grant funding for your application it is necessary for the project to have open source code.
We prefer Apache 2.0, but MIT or Unlicense are also acceptable. If your delivery comprises multiple repositories, make sure to include the license for each of them.

## Documentation

We value high-quality open source code, but even the most performant code is of little use if it lacks proper documentation.

We require that you document (where applicable):

- API calls
- Architecture overview and individual component details
- Algorithms and protocols that are core to your project
- Any other fundamental building blocks to your technology

Unless absolutely necessary, make the documentation public as well, ideally as part of the appropriate code repository. This will make it easier for the community to use or adapt your project.

**Note**: Only focus on your **own** contributions. Do not write detailed explanations of already existing components, e.g. IPFS.

## Formatted code

A codebase that is easy to read is also easy to use. We suggest adopting one style from Day 1 and adhering to it across the entire team.
This helps to keep the commit history clean and facilitates any reviews of the introduced changes.

For **Rust**, we encourage formatting any additional support libraries or helpers by following the [Style Guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/README.html).

For **any other** deliveries, please commit to a particular style & let us know which official guidelines you adopt.

## Testing Guide

We require that each milestone delivery includes a comprehensive test suite, consisting of:

### A step-by-step guide demonstrating how your code achieves the milestones

Please provide documentation on how to install, compile, run and test the deliverable(s). Make sure to include all necessary prerequisites. Common issues while replicating test results involve, among others, undocumented dependencies, version numbers, local database setups, breaking changes in the main branch since delivery, OS- and browser-specific incompatibilities.

Depending on the deliverable, this could include (but is not limited to)

- how to embed your library in another application,
- how to make example API calls to your service,
- running your web app, and
- steps to complete some desired action in your mobile app.

### Unit tests

As with any quality software project, each logical code component should be testable.

### Integration tests

We prefer dockerfiles to avoid problems with versions and dependencies.

**Note**: If you are not delivering code as part of your project, such a test suite is not applicable. This mainly applies to projects centering on design, research or hardware. If that is the case, please provide detailed instructions on how else we can test/run/replicate your deliverable.

## Milestone Deliverables

Please provide a list of milestone deliverables. This list should closely reflect the list of deliverables agreed on in the Pull Request for the public **Grants Program** application or in Annex 1 of the grant contract for the private applications.

Each item in the list should include a link to the deliverable itself, e.g.:

- Google Doc link - make sure anyone with the link has View access
- GitHub repository - include the appropriate file/folder in the link

**Please highlight anything that deviates from the contract** and include further information that you think is relevant to the deliverable, either alongside the appropriate deliverable or under [Additional Information](#additional-information).

Please ensure the repo has the correct open-source license.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | https://github.com/.../LICENSE | ... |
| 0b. | Documentation | ... | ... |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | ... | ... |
| 1. | ... | ... | ... |
| 2. | ... | ... | ... |

## Additional Information

Please add any additional comments that you consider relevant for the evaluation.
