# NDC Gov v1

The NEAR Digital Collective (NDC), the largest decentralization effort on any layer 1 blockchain, has spent much of 2023 designing a number of frameworks that will allow any member of the NEAR Protocol network to have a say in how NEAR is run. NDC’s goal is to combine transparency, collective decision making, evolving governance models, and self-determination in a completely new way.

After laying this decentralization groundwork, the NDC is gearing up for its first elections.

## NDC V1 Governance Structure

NDC V1 Governance includes three elected houses, a voting body, and a community treasury. The qualification to run for V1 governance requires an OG SBT. Elected Community members (OG’s) of each house are responsible for planning, overseeing, and allocating funding aligned with the ecosystems Northstar to grow and decentralize NEAR.

| Name of the House  | House of Merit (HoM)                                                                        | Council of Advisors (CoA)                                                               | Transparency Commission (TC)                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Seats              | 15                                                                                          | 7                                                                                       | 7                                                                                                               |
| Responsibilities   | In charge of allocating the treasury and deploying capital for the growth of the ecosystem. | In charge of vetoing proposals from the HoM and guiding the deployment of the treasury. | In charge of keeping behavior of elected officials clean, and making sure cartels do not form in the ecosystem. |
| Commitment         | 5-20 hours weekly with a minimum participation threshold.                                   | 5-20 hours weekly with a minimum participation threshold.                               | 5-20 hours weekly with a minimum participation threshold.                                                       |
| Expertise Required | Budgetary expertise for ecosystem-wide budget planning, treasury management, and review.    | Strategic minds to advise the House of Merit and hold budget veto power.                | Unbiased guardians of the treasury that investigate and remove bad actors.                                      |

## Why Should You Care?

### How can my vote shape the future of the NEAR ecosystem?

By engaging in the election process, you get to help determine the direction of the NDC and the future of decentralization on NEAR. This is not like a presidential election where your vote is a thimble of water added to a sea. Every vote in the NDC election actually makes a difference, and some of the elected positions will likely come down to just a few votes. When the candidates have very different policy positions, each vote has a potentially outsize impact.

### How else does my vote matter?

By participating in the elections process and on-chain voting, you are also contributing to your own on-chain reputation.

### Why should you run for office?

If you’re an OG, we need your expertise and authentic commitment to the continued growth, success, and most importantly… Decentralization of NEAR. This is an opportunity for you to actualize an incredible future for NEAR.

## Nominations

In order to run for office, you must hold an [OG SBT](https://i-am-human.app/community-sbts). These aren’t given out to just anyone; these are for people that have been actively contributing to the NEAR ecosystem for extended periods of time. The OG criteria are discussed separately and are reviewed by the OG Committee.

If you already have an OG SBT, you can [self-nominate](https://www.near.org/nomination.ndctools.near/widget/NDC.Nomination.Page) yourself in order to run for elections.

To find out the full criteria and to see if you qualify, please refer to [Safeguards](#safeguards) and OG. If you still require help, head over to the official NDC Telegram and ask a member of the team for help.

### What information will be available in the candidate profiles?

The candidate profiles are on BOS Nomination and will contain their name, background, affiliation, and policy positions. The profiles should give you a clear overview of what to expect should you select them as your preferred candidate. You can choose to upvote the candidate and comment on the candidate profiles as long as you are registered through [I-AM-HUMAN](https://i-am-human.app).

## Elections

The only criteria to run for elections is to _self nominate_.

Nomination starts the NDC v1 governance process and runs for 50 days and allow the community to rally their candidates. The nomination ends on September 7, and the election starts on September 8 and runs for two weeks. The elected representatives are onboarded for one week, and begin to organize the first government for the NEAR ecosystem.

- Nomination Period: July 19th to September 7th, 2023
- Election Period: September 8th – September 22nd, 2023
- Start of 1st Congress: October 1st – April 1st, 2024

### Participation

The main ways to participate in the NDC election are of course voting for candidates or running as a candidate, but there’s a lot more to it than just that. Through our Nominations platform, voters and candidates will be able to engage with one another discussing policy positions and contribute to candidacy social proof through commenting or upvoting.

### Safeguards

It goes without saying that we want as fair and transparent an election as possible. Given that we are remote, and that the internet can be a strange place, there have been certain safeguards implemented into all NDC elections, that deter poor behavior, and also guarantee that bad actors are punished if they are able to manipulate an election. Election integrity can ultimately be broken down into six clear safeguards:

#### Safeguard 1. Fair Voting Policy

Voters agreement to not sell votes. On behalf of all voters, holding an I-Am-Human verified account, you agree when you vote, that you will not sell your vote. If it turns out that you do sell your vote, you are eligible to post-election enforcement from the TC (see safeguard 6).

#### Safeguard 2. Candidate Agreement to Transparency and Accountability to not buy votes

On the candidates’ side, they all also agree to not buy votes for their election, and are equally eligible for post-election enforcement if they are found guilty.

#### Safeguard 3. Captcha Oracle (not confirmed)

Included in each and every vote, to prevent scripting.

#### Safeguard 4. Ongoing monitoring

Pikes Peak review Election results ongoing/after. NEAR is fortunate enough to have the data visualization and tracking capabilities of Pikespeak, active and involved in the ecosystem. As a core supporter of NDC, Pikes Peak is also going to be monitoring election results both during and after the election to identify any anomalies and ensure it is done as fairly as possible.

#### Safeguard 5. Whistleblower program and bounty

A proactive initiative is established to counteract users who engage in activities like purchasing votes and other behaviors described in the `fair-voting-policy`. This initiative incorporates incentives for users who report such behaviors, aiming to encourage them to flag these instances and subsequently rewarding them for their vigilance.

Anyone who has knowledge of potential election fraud SHOULD report it. All reports will receive a bounty assuming their claims as to people and impact are justified and accurate.

#### Safeguard 6. Enforcement by Transparency Commission

In the event of any serious election fraud the investigation, and decision to remove, or forever ban either a voter or a candidate, will lie with the Transparency Commission. This means that there is ultimately no escape for a wrongdoer once they have been discovered or accused. The official Transparency Commission process is to field a complaint, investigate the complaint, and then publicly move to either remove, or ban the member in question from further participation.

### FAQ

#### What should I consider before voting for a candidate?

Just like in any civic election, you should familiarize yourself with the policy positions of the candidates as well as their backgrounds. All candidates will have been vetted and have an “OG SBT,” but will likely have widely divergent views on the direction of the NDC. Asking questions and commenting on their platforms can also be a valuable way to get clarity on any positions that seem unclear to you.

#### Can I change my vote once I’ve submitted it?

Since all votes are recorded on the blockchain, they are immutable and cannot be changed after submission. Therefore it is in your best interest to triple check your selections before hitting that “submit” button.

#### What procedures will be in place to ensure election integrity?

We would love to see every single person in the NEAR ecosystem vote in NDC elections, but in order to maintain election integrity, there is one important requirement in order to cast a valid ballot. You will need to have a Face-Verified Soul Bound Token (SBT) linked with a NEAR wallet. You may use your main wallet or create a new one explicitly for the purpose of voting.

#### Does Face Verification mean you have a picture of my face connected to my wallet?

No. [I-AM-HUMAN](https://i-am-human.app) does not store your biometrics. You are also free to request the deletion of any and all data collected in this process should you decide to forfeit your FV SBT.

## Flagged Accounts

For the IAH registry we introduced a new feature: account flagging. It's a separate from SBT, because it can't be burned and doesn't have expiration time. Any authorized flagger can flag any account as _verified_ (aka whitelisted) or blacklisted.

A verified account is an account that went through a manual verification and constitutes higher level of credibility. Initially it's related to the Community SBT ownership.

A blacklist constitutes a roster of accounts contained within the `Registry` that have been flagged for restriction. Through the automated blockchain analysis or the deliberations of an IAH committee, an account can be added to the blacklist, leading to a suspension of its voting privileges and exclusion from receiving any SBTs. Should an account find itself on the blacklist, there exists a provision for filing an appeal with the committee. Upon approval of the appeal, the user's status will be lifted from the blacklist.

For a comprehensive overview, please refer to the detailed I Am Human [Account Flagging Specification](https://near-ndc.notion.site/IAH-Flag-Accounts-b5b9c2ff72d14328834e2a0effa22938). In the future new models will be explored to asses accounts credibility and reputation.

## Post-Election

Election results will be announced on the NDC’s Medium, Telegram, and Discord and will also be viewable in the Election UI. Winning candidates will be highlighted in green.

After the election results are announced, the elected representatives will convene for the first time in the first NDC governance town hall, where we will hear from elected members from the three branches of NDC governance.

# Code of Conduct

Near Social [version](https://near.org/neardigitalcollective.near/widget/NDCDocs_OneArticle?articleId=CommunityGuidelines&blockHeight=91522833&lastEditor=neardigitalcollective.near
).

## Introduction

The NDC Community is made up of an amazing array of individuals and projects from different cultures and backgrounds. We strive to maintain a welcoming and respectful community for all members.
Like any diverse community, it’s important there are rules in place to allow everyone to feel safe working towards building a decentralized future.
The NDC has worked on versions of Codes of Conduct before. However, the GWG wanted to simplify them in places, and also provide guidance for how the community might handle bad actors, so there’s a section on that below.
Perhaps most importantly, these guidelines should serve as a springboard for the community to gather around, and improve on with time.

## NDC Community Code Of Conduct

Let’s think about language

- In dealing with people all around the world, we have to be cautious of the use of language. Language can be filled with historical baggage that can be interpreted as harmful or offensive to others.
- This can be related, but not limited to, age, gender, religious, racial, economic status, social background, health, or sex.
- If language does cause offense, it’s important to acknowledge that and find ways of working past it. That might not be possible, but as a first port of call, we all need to hold ourselves and each other to account.

We’re not going to get it right the first time. But as a rule, the community endeavors to work towards understanding and acceptance.

No to violence

- The NDC community abhors violence in any form, and it has collective power to eject anyone from the community that either incites or commits those acts themselves.

Don’t play the blame game

- There’s a fine line between constructive criticism or feedback and attacks and or harassment. The community should endeavor to always be considerate of others when suggesting improvements, or discussing topics.
- Providing repetitive criticism without showing intent to improve a situation, resolve a problem or help another person, is equal to complaining and considered toxic behavior. This will likely lead to defensive responses on the receiving end and is unlikely to lead to any valuable progress.
- Lively conversations and feedback are essential to a healthy community. However, when this is not formulated in a constructive manner, moderators will intervene and forward the person providing the feedback to a sticky post on the forum. This can be found in the [gov forum](https://gov.near.org/t/gwg-ndc-constructive-feedback/33545).

This is where feedback can be formulated in a constructive manner, provided with the right inputs to move things forward. Moderators will moderate the [community guidelines](https://gov.near.org/t/community-guidelines-march-2023/33544) post and flag any feedback to the appropriate individuals in order to address this feedback.

### What happens when someone steps over the line?

- With any community, be it digital or IRL, there needs to be a way of escalating issues or removing bad actors.
- The NDC Mods are enforcing a three strikes and you’re out rule. So if a member of the community has received three strikes from moderators, they will be ejected from the community.
- Warnings and bans will be documented in a to-be-created sticky topic on the NDC gov forum. This can be found at [Enforcing Community Guidelines: Warnings and Bans](https://gov.near.org/t/enforcing-community-guidelines-warnings-and-bans/33546). Documentation will consist of screenshot(s) of the offense and an explanation why a warning or ban is in place.
- On special occasions, moderators hold the authority to ban users without warning if all mods unanimously agree that it is an appropriate penalty.
- To make this enforceable, the NDC is currently exploring on-chain KYC toolkits that would make it difficult for ejected actors to re-enter the community using a different name.

### Dispute resolution

Whenever a community member is banned for breaking the Community Guidelines, they can dispute this once by requesting a public vote in the Telegram Group. Once NDCs Proof-of-Personhood (i-am-human) is live, this will be conducted on the appropriate platform (NEAR Social) to counter Sybil attacks.

### Evolving the code of conduct

This is a living document. This means that what is stated here will and can change, if the community deems it so.

# Community Treasury

The NEAR Community Treasury (hereinafter "NDC Trust") is intended to serve as a decentralised treasury for the NEAR ecosystem.

👉 [Community Treasury Framework](https://near-ndc.notion.site/WIP-Community-Treasury-Framework-1cdbbf304c2846cda641d3c23e702d72?pvs=4)

## Funding HoM

HoM is funded by Community Treasury based on a [Setup Package](https://www.notion.so/Setup-Package-6df6ec7ac92d4703af1fee4a89c61da1). The Setup Package is a document with funding request providing details about the budget and line items. Think of it as the budget plan and rulebook that guides how value is allocated from the community treasury into the ecosystem. There can be more than one setup package proposal per term.

1. HoM makes a proposal for Voting Body to approve a Setup Package.
2. Once the Setup Package is approved, Community Treasury will fund the HoM DAO. The final process is still work in progress. Options

   - Trust will send funds once a month based on the total budget, being approved by the Voting Body.
   - Trust will send funds separately for each line item.

## Funding DAOs

# The Constitution of the NEAR Digital Collective (NDC)

The NEAR Constitution is first and foremost a living document, undergoing active polling, edits, feedback, and iterations from the many collaborators inside and beyond the NEAR Digital Collective. We are currently at Year 0 in a decade-long roll-out of on-chain governance in the NEAR Ecosystem. That means there is always a seat at the table for thoughtful input and collaborative feedback.

Our fast-growing community known as the NEAR Digital collective operates as a public square for all stakeholders inside of the NEAR Ecosystem. Governance on NEAR holds the promise of bringing these stakeholders together to align financially, socially, and technologically on where to take the ecosystem in the future. But to do this successfully, we need to all agree on certain key principles and values:

1. **Inclusiveness**: This entire process is meant to improve the ecosystem! This means that the NDC will not infringe on any protocol or dApp building on NEAR, nor will it operate in a biased manner in its selection of members or collective feedback sessions. A transparency commission exists for this very reason (See below!).

1. **Adaptability**: Crypto moves fast, and tends to be volatile. The NDC is here to stay for the long-term. Adaptability is all about being antifragile in the face of adversity, tough market conditions, or challenges that face the protocol. Our mindset is to work through and beyond problems.

1. **Transparency**: As one of the largest on-chain treasuries in all of crypto, we have a responsibility to our community and the future stakeholders of the NEAR Ecosystem to operate fully transparently. This is the expectation of every public servant and participant in governance through the NDC.

1. **Ecosystem First**: Mercenaries are abundant in crypto - especially in bear markets. Working and helping out with the NDC requires all members to put the Ecosystem first. This means that contributors are expected to deliver and build a reputation for themselves amongst their peers in the NDC, before expecting rewards. The NDC is first and foremost a culture and a vision - not a job!

1. **Anti-Cartel**: In line with the above principles - If you have a conflict of interest, declare it BEFORE you participate. This should go without saying but for extra clarity to all members - a successful NDC requires honest and authentic actors working for the ecosystem as a whole.
   Collective Decision Making: As you will read further below, all positions are democratically elected, with major decisions always being in control of the voting body. Voting is fundamental to the NDC and creating a living governance system of active and engaged human beings.

1. **Freedom to Be Yourself**: There is no discrimination or censorship within the NDC. In line with the aforementioned principles, every member has a right to an opinion and a position on the future of the ecosystem. Being respectful in promoting or sharing that opinion is still expected.

1. **Commons for Everyone**: Our ultimate objective is to make the NDC the most lively, engaged, and exciting place to be in crypto. Smack-dab in the center of the NEAR Ecosystem, the NDC ensures that no member (participating or not) will be subjected to attacks, insults, or discrimination of any kind. This is a safe digital environment to work for a positive future for the NEAR Ecosystem.

1. **Reputation Responsive**: Valuing experience, and the contributions of tried-and-tested loyal NEAR natives is encouraged across all NDC institutions and constellations. The importance of learning from the past and charting a better course of action in the future starts by listening to those who have stuck around through thick and thin.

1. **Human Powered**: The NDC is governed by and for the human community of the NEAR Ecosystem. This means bots, AI LLM’s and other non-human intelligences are not eligible to be used in any of the human roles of the governance process.

In light of these principles, our goal is simple and straightforward: To connect community values to decision-making and budget allocation of the NEAR Treasury, through transparency, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. By doing so, we're building a stronger and more resilient NEAR ecosystem that can thrive for decades to come.

Our Constitution outlines the structure of the NDC, including the Governance Body, Voting Body, and Community Treasury. These entities work together to manage resources, guide the strategic direction of NEAR, and ensure that governance is a reflection of our community values.

The Governance Body consists of (1) the House of Merit, (2) the Council of Advisors, and (3) the Transparency Commission. Each institution serves a unique purpose:

1. **House of Merit** (15 Members to start): Composed of members who have demonstrated outstanding contributions to the NEAR Ecosystem, their role is to propose legislation and allocate the budget, acting as the engine that drives initiatives forward.

1. **Council of Advisors** (7 Members to start): A group of elected representatives responsible for vetoing poor decisions from the House of Merit, acting as a brake that ensures the long-term sustainability and growth of the NEAR Ecosystem.

1. **Transparency Commission** (7 Members to start): Tasked with removing or banning malicious members from participation, the Transparency Commission serves as an emergency stop that keeps the governance process transparent, accountable, and free from conflicts of interest.

1. **The Voting Body** (All of us!) consisting of all Humans on NEAR, plays a crucial role in the decision-making process by electing all positions within the Governance Body. Additionally, the Voting Body has the power to veto big budget items, recurring budget items, and dissolve entire houses if they are deemed incompetent.

Amendments to the Constitution can be proposed and passed through the House of Merit, ensuring our governance can adapt and grow with the needs of the ecosystem.

With the NDC we embrace the power of decentralized governance to create a committed, aligned, and passionate community that makes NEAR a household name beyond Crypto.

In the spirit of optimism and collaboration, we invite everyone to join us in building a better future for the NEAR Ecosystem and beyond.

# Elections Voting Process

Elections provides an on-chain method for casting votes and appointing members to various houses. The following documentation outlines the primary steps involved and provides an explanation of the key features that govern the voting process.

## Voting Process

See [Elections](./README.md#Elections) for general overview of the Nominations, Gov v1 and FAQ.

1. Prior to the elections start, the Elections Commission will setup 4 proposals with correct list of candidates, start time, end time and cooldown period:
   - HoM elections
   - CoA elections
   - TC elections
   - [Setup Package](./community-treasury.md#funding-hom) approval.
1. Once the proposals are active (between start and end time), each [eligible voter](#eligible-voters) can cast only one vote per proposals. Votes can not be updated nor recast.
   - When casting a vote, voter must [bond](#bonding) NEAR.
   - Voter must pay for all storage fees.
1. According to the [safeguards](./README.md#safeguards), Elections Commission will be empowered to [revoke](#vote-revocation) any vote which violates Fair Voting Policy.
1. Elections ends after the cooldown period. At this time, results can be queried from the smart contract.

NOTE: Proposals and candidates can only be submitted by the Elections Commission, following the process approved by the community. Candidates must come from the nominations contract.

M --> M1[Candidates Ding and Burn OG SBT plus 2yr barred from NDC funding];
```

### Cooldown

The cooldown period serves as an intermediary span bridging the conclusion of voting and the establishment of its validity. Within this timeframe, any votes violating the `fair-voting-policy` will be revoked and the corresponding actions outlined in the policy will be enacted against the user.

### Elections End

The Elections contract must have a final end time, which will be a max of `proposal.end + proposal.cooldown + 1 day` of every proposal added to elections. The extra 1 day is required to give a time to setup the tie break.

### Tie Break

- Only matters if there is a tie at the very tail.
- Options: a) extend number of seats, b) reduce number of seats, c) tie break session - elections only for people at tie.
  - Tie break session with reduced voting period (eg 2 days)
  - Option c) is selected to execute Tie Braeks.

In case of a Tie Break, the elections period will be extended and new proposals will be added by the Elections Commission to setup the tie break.

## Eligible Voters

Any person with a Face Verified Soul Bound Token (SBT) is eligible to vote, and anyone can get one with a NEAR wallet through I-AM-HUMAN.

Other criteria that are discussed:

- staking
- bonding
- activity

## Bonding

Bonding entails a mandatory deposit of NEAR tokens that each user must furnish prior to casting their vote. This mechanism operates as a protective measure. The bonded amount remains inaccessible until the voting cooldown period elapses. In the event that a user violates the `fair-voting-policy`, their bonded tokens will be slashed by executing `vote_revoke`.

- Each voter must firstly bond **3N** to cast their vote. It will be integrated in the voting procedure and the contract must return attached tokens (minus the storage fees) if a voter already bonded the tokens.
- One bond is enough to cast votes for all proposals.

## I Voted SBT

The Elections contract will act as an issuer for the IAH Registry.

Once the elections are [over](#elections-end) anyone will be able to recover his bond by calling `elections.unbond` method. Moreover, the method will mint `I_Voted` SBT if the voter voted for ALL proposals. The contract will return the bonded NEAR minus storage fees required to mint the `I Voted` SBT.

## Vote Revocation

Vote revocation is a system put in place to allow for the cancellation of votes that have violated the policy.

Usually such event is paired with the IAH [Blacklist](./README.md#Blacklist). Once a user is blacklisted, any user can initiate the process of revoking blacklisted users votes.

More specifically, elections contract provides a `revoke_vote` method that allows the Elections Commission or `iah_registry` to revoke a vote. In the latter case anyone can trigger the call and the blacklist check will be required.

- Votes can be revoked any time between proposal.start and proposal.end + cooldown period. Revoked vote can't be recast.
- Elections Commission will be able to blacklist any user and revoke any vote.
- Everyone will be able to revoke a vote of a blacklisted user by using `iah_registry.is_human_call`.

## Summary

There are four governing bodies of the NDC Governance Framework. Each governing body has specific roles and capabilities such that a system of checks and balances can develop. The role and powers vested in these different governing bodies provide a robust framework for ensuring governance of the Community Treasury in line with NEAR values and the ecosystem objectives.
At a high level, the balance of powers between these governing bodies can be understood in the following manner:

### Voting Body

All non-blacklisted human verified (using [I Am Human (**IAH**)](https://i-am-human.app/)) accounts. There are no requirements for being a member of the voting body beyond possession of 'I am Human' face verification SBT and not being in the [blacklist](https://near.org/neardigitalcollective.near/widget/NDCDocs_OneArticle?articleId=Election_Integrity%E2%80%94Voter_Verification_Update&blockHeight=100436088&lastEditor=neardigitalcollective.near).

### Council of Advisors

Role: Advise and Block.

While the Council of Advisors sits in support of the HoM and maintains the ability to block a proposal or removal request, they are beholden to the HoM for the passage of proposals. Meanwhile, they are also beholden to the Transparency Commission insofar as they cannot remove members or investigate them.

### House of Merit

Role: Propose and Allocate.

While the HoM has the ability to propose legislation proactively, they are beholden to the Council of Advisors and ongoing checks if poor leadership is repeated over time. In the same vein, they are also accountable to the Transparency Commission in terms of ethics and transparency of their role.

### Transparency Commission

Role: Investigate and Remove.

While the Transparency Commission commands the sole power of hearing complaints, investigating members of both the HoM and the CoA, and to either extend an investigation, retain a member after investigation, or remove that member as a result of the investigation. CoA has the ability to allow someone who has been removed from their post to run for future sessions, only after they have been removed.

### Notes

All three institutions elect speakers at the beginning of each congress, and all institutions are required to meet weekly - with the HoM required to meet every 2 - 3 days.

As this system evolves, each governing body has the ability to both support and limit the actions of the adjacent governing bodies. In this manner, while the system will evolve every election cycle with new members, the system itself will retain its functionality.

### House Voting Criteria

In this section we describe HoM, CoA and TC voting mechanism.

Each house has the following voting parameters:

- `approval_threshold`: minimum amount of approvals cast during the voting period to approve a proposal.
- `vote_duration`: maximum amount of time a proposal is active for voting.
- `min_vote_duration`: minimum amount of time a proposal is active for voting, unless all members voted. This parameter is introduced to let other members vote (and express their opinion) even if the voting result is already established.
- `cooldown`: additional amount of time to hold off proposal approval. It's used to give extra time for veto motion.

A proposal, when created, is immediately active for voting until:

- all voters voted;
- or `min_vote_duration` didn't pass and voting is result is not established;
- or `min_vote_duration` passed and voting result is established.
- or `vote_duration` is over.

When a proposal is active, any member can vote to approve, reject or abstain.

Cooldown (if non zero) starts once proposal is got at least `approval_threshold` votes and the proposal is not active. Cooldown will block the proposal to be executed, to give a authorized parties to veto it.

**Approval Criteria**:
Vote to motion passes once `approval_threshold` votes in favor AND cooldown passed without any veto from authorized party.

**Rejection Criteria**:
Not receiving `approval_threshold` votes in favor nor veto from CoA (where relevant). If a proposal gets enough rejection and abstain votes to make approval not possible, then it will be rejected.

**Tie Breaking**:
No Tie is possible. If a member is removed prior to next election, then a hard majority of `approval_threshold` votes in favor must still be obtained, and grid-locked is taken as a rejected Motion.

## Council of Advisors (CoA)

> **Processes & Procedure = Supportive, Defensive**

<aside>
⚠️ TL;DR: The Council of Advisors is responsible for advising, publicly prioritizing, and in cases of recurring issues, blocking actions of the two different governing bodies.

The Council of Advisors operates on a _weekly time frame_ where their primary activities are to:

1. Set Priorities for the HoM,
2. Evaluate HoM , and
3. Vote to Motion
   1. against any HoM proposal,
   1. against an implemented proposal,
   1. overturn a TC ban and unban the member's eligibility to run in subsequent elections.

TC can dismiss any member from any house (including from TC itself), and moreover ban (`GovBan` I Am Human flag).
CoA can unban a member (remove `GovBan`flag) at any time to run for future sessions (it will NOT bring him back to the office in the existing term).

</aside>

**Membership:** 7 members.

**Total Terms:** Max of 2 terms per individual.

**Tenure per Term:** 6 months.

**DAO Parameters:** `approval_threshold = 4, vote_duration = 5 days, min_vote_duration = 3 days, cooldown = 0 days`

**Appointment Eligibility Criteria:** Satisfying [OG SBT](https://near.org/neardigitalcollective.near/widget/NDCDocs_OneArticle?articleId=NDCV1-Safeguards&OGSBT&blockHeight=96512909&lastEditor=vikash.near) criteria.

**Removal Criteria:** Complaint and investigation from filing to TC followed by a motion to remove.

**Salaries**: (Based on contribution level)

1. Speakers and core contributors to each house will generally contribute more hours; some part-time and full-time resources may be required.
2. Hours vary based on representative availability, proposal volume, and process definition needs.

### Processes, Timelines & Key Stakeholders

| Process                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                | Time Frame                            | Key Stakeholders   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Motion to Veto the Setup Package                 | Either expedite the passage (approve), or veto the passage of the new congress’ setup package                                                              | 3 days to 1 month per vetoed proposal | CoA, HoM           |
| Motion to Veto an Active or Implemented Proposal | Vote to veto a passed proposal from the House of Merit                                                                                                     | 3 days to 1 month per vetoed proposal | CoA, HoM           |
| Formally Set Priorities for Congress             | Clarify the priorities the Council sees as most important, and to indicate what types of proposals may be most or least successful                         | As needed                             | CoA                |
| Evaluate Performance of Governance Bodies        | Signal to the voting body the performance of both the House of Merit and the Transparency Commission, or to jolt either house to improve their performance | As needed                             | CoA, Voting Body   |
| Unban members, banned by TC                      | Ability to re-instate banned members                                                                                                                       | As needed                             | CoA, Banned Member |

### Minimum Threshold of Engagement for CoA

| Activity            | Minimum Threshold | Frequency    | Implication of Failure | Notes                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Meeting Attendance  | 60%               | Per Month    | Subject to Removal     | Required to maintain active status |
| Voting on Proposals | 70%               | Per Proposal | Subject to Removal     | Required to maintain active status |

The Council of Advisors operates on a weekly time frame. The essence of their job is to help the HoM set ecosystem priorities in parallel to evaluating HoM and TC performance for the month prior. In the event that there is a divergence in HoM operations and the vision of the CoA, they are able to motion to block a proposal or policy from the HoM. This motion to block can take place during and/or after a proposal or action has been taken by the HoM.

**Timeframe: Weekly**.

### Proposals and Voting

At least `approval_threshold` approvals are required to pass a proposal. This structure ensures that the Council of Advisors serves primarily as a safeguard against ill-advised decisions, rather than as an active governing body in the governance and implementation of proposals.

- Veto a HoM proposal:
  - veto must be approved by CoA before the HoM proposal cooldown finishes.
- Vote against an implemented proposal and vote to appeal and overturn a TC ban and unban the member's eligibility to run in subsequent elections.
  - Can be proposed at any time.
- Overturn a TC ban. TC can remove a member from the office - that member is ineligible to serve for the remainder of that term. However, they may run in future elections. Additionally, TC can decide to ban a member from running in future elections, the member's OG SBT is burnt and the members is flagged with `GovBan` flag, rendering them ineligible for future candidacy.
  **Appeal Process to the CoA**:
  - Banned members have the right to appeal their ban to the CoA.
  - If the CoA finds in favor of the appealing member, the following technical process is initiated: a new OG SBT is minted for the member and `GovBan` flag is removed, reinstating their eligibility to run in subsequent elections.

#### Appeal Process

No appeal. Simply requires a re-submission of the vote to motion.

### Ongoing Activities

- Release Priorities for the Ecosystem for HoM.
- Release Evaluation of Activities from HoM and TC.
- Motion to block or overturn ongoing or existing decisions or policies.

## House of Merit (HoM)

> **Processes & Procedure = Active, Directive**

<aside>
⚠️ *Tl/Dr: T*he House of Merit is responsible for proposing, passing, and allocating **Funding Proposals** from the NEAR Treasury within an agreed-upon Budget Package agreed with the CoA, to hire or create new roles for the NDC itself, and to alter any protocol governed mechanics or public goods. The HoM is the primary engine of policy implementation and budget allocation for the governance of the NEAR Ecosystem. The HoM operates on a *weekly* timeframe, whereby a proposal is voted on. In order for a proposal to be implemented it requires a hard majority of 8 votes in the HoM and for the not being vetoed.

</aside>

**Membership:** 15 elected members (or less, if a member has been removed).

**Total Terms:** Max of 2 terms per individual.

**Tenure per Term:** 6 months.

**DAO Parameters:** `approval_threshold = 8, vote_duration = 5 days, min_vote_duration = 3 days, cooldown = 7 days` . Cooldown allows CoA and VB to veto a proposal during the proposal voting and after 7 days after a proposal passed. The proposal can’t be executed after the cooldown is over.

**Appointment Eligibility Criteria:** Satisfying [OG SBT](https://near.org/neardigitalcollective.near/widget/NDCDocs_OneArticle?articleId=NDCV1-Safeguards&OGSBT&blockHeight=96512909&lastEditor=vikash.near) criteria.

**Removal Criteria:** Complaint and investigation from filing to TC followed by a motion to remove.

**Salaries**: (Based on contribution level)

1. Speakers and core contributors to each house will generally contribute more hours; some part-time and full-time resources may be required.
2. Hours vary based on representative availability, proposal volume, and process definition needs.

### Minimum Threshold of Engagement for HoM

| Activity            | Minimum Threshold | Frequency    | Implication of Failure | Notes                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

| Proposal Creation   | 2                 | Per Term     | Subject to Removal     | Required to maintain active status |

The HoM is required to meet every 2 to 3 weekdays at minimum. This allows the HoM to move quickly and iterate efficiently. Any HoM member can make a proposal and put it into motion. 8 votes in favor is required to pass. The voting period for all votes last for 5 days once they are proposed (the proposal creator decides when they are proposed).

Timeframe:

- Meetings at least every 2 to 3 weekdays
- Voting is on-going and asynchronous.

### Budget **Package - 1st Order of Business:**

---

At the beginning of every new congress, the first order of business is for the HoM to create and propose a new **Budget Package**. This package defines the budget for the upcoming **Congress**:

- Budget for the current **Congress**.
- Agreement between CoA and HoM on what to spend funds on.
- Must be created within the confines of the most recent valid Setup Package (which would typically have been proposed by the previous congress and recently have been approved during the election period).
- Typically contains line items for each Constellation and Node, with monthly projected spend for each line item.
- Note: The budget in v1 is a text based document. For this reason, Funding Proposals will require manual / off-chain validation against the budget.

The HoM must also elect a Speaker at the beginning of each Congress. The Speaker is in charge of setting and running meetings of the HoM, deciding which topics are to be covered or require further discussion in order to optimize the institution's efficiency. The Speaker can be replaced during a Congress following a vote of no-confidence.

<aside>
⚠️  note that they HoM can propose to change params of the existing session. It’s going to be done as a Text proposal, and requires a Voting Body approval. That means, once HoM approves new budget with new params, the HoM must propose to VB to ratify this change.

</aside>

HoM can’t change the following params:

- Cap Budget Item: maximum value of the single proposal.
- term limit → DAO must have “end time”.
- recurring budget item max size = 6 months. It's an item that is processed sequentially on the interval by the trust (renews automatically without another vote by the HoM or check by CoA). Vetoing it doesn’t have additional tech callback - it’s processed by trustees.
- session budget: max budget they can operate.

HoM can change the following params:

- `hom.big_budget_size = 75k USD` (initial one). It is set by the HoM and it is for them to define what items of size they would like to set as thresholds for VB checks,

The initial parameters are defined by the _Initial Setup Package_, which is voted by the Voting Body during Elections.

### Setup Package - Last Order of Business

<aside>
⚠️ this is not implemented and will require approval from HoM to implement it.
</aside>

[Setup Package Overview](https://www.notion.so/Setup-Package-Overview-6df6ec7ac92d4703af1fee4a89c61da1?pvs=21)

At the end of every **Congress**, the last order of business is for the HoM to create and propose a new **Setup Package** . This package defines the following for the next **Congress**:

- Total budget cap for the next congressional period.
- Threshold (amount) for a **Funding Proposal** to be deemed a ‘big budget policy’.
- Threshold (amount) for how much any one recipient / Constellation / Node can receive in a month.
- Procedural changes to timers or cycles (after the first session).
- Changes to the composition and function of the HoM, CoA, or TC.

This **Setup Package** sets the precedent for how the new **Congress** will operate. Only after the **Voting Body** has passed the **Setup Package** does the HoM commence operations.

### Proposals

Proposal lifetime: `created → HoM voting → cooldown`.

CoA has veto power over all active or recurrent proposals.
Voting Body has veto power over Funding Proposals above the big budget threshold value and Recurring Funding Proposals.

#### Setup Package

A **[Setup Package](https://www.notion.so/Setup-Package-Overview-6df6ec7ac92d4703af1fee4a89c61da1?pvs=21)** can be proposed by any member in either the HoM or CoA, and must then pass a simple majority by the **Voting Body** in a general election, before being implemented (1 week implementation time). A minimum of 1 **Setup Package** must be proposed prior to a general election.

- If one **Setup Package** has been proposed, then it will be a approve or reject or abstain vote which must pass with a simple majority, i.e. more votes in favor than votes against, by the **Voting Body** in a general election.
- If more than one **Setup Package** has been proposed then voters in the **Voting Body** will be given one vote each and can cast it either in favor of the **Setup Package** that they prefer, or can abstain. The **Setup Package** with the most votes in favor wins.
- General elections are subject to an 8% quorum requirement, inclusive of any “abstain” votes cast.

#### Funding Proposal

- Each **Funding Proposal** must first fit within the confines of the parameters defined in the **Setup Package** before it can be created. The Smart Contract will validate and enforce these rules and will not allow creation of a **Funding Proposal** that violates the **Setup Package**.
- Recurring **Funding Proposals,** and one-off **Funding Proposals** above the big budget threshold value, require 8 votes in favor in the HoM, and then a subsequent CoA approval.
- Non recurring **Funding Proposals** below the big budget threshold value require 8 votes in favor in the HoM and the absence of a CoA veto.

#### Budget Proposal

- Require HoM [approval](#house-voting-criteria) in favor in the HoM, and then a subsequent CoA approval.

#### Proposal to change gov mechanics

Require Voting Body approval with **Near Supermajority Consent**.

#### Other proposals

HoM can make Text based proposals. That should cover all proposals that don't require additional VB approval and are not covered above. Example: long term strategy (focus), hiring etc...:

### Appeal Process

Re-proposal the following week.

### Growth

After the first congress, 2 new members are added to the House of Merit each Congress, until there are 31 members total. The threshold to pass a vote is simultaneously increased by one, until the threshold reaches 16.

## Transparency Commission (TC)

> **Processes & Procedure = Investigate and Remove**

<aside>
⚠️ Tldr:The Transparency Commission (TC) is responsible for maintaining proper procedure and governance of the NDC for the benefit of the ecosystem. This applies on four levels: (1) For initiate and (or) the removal of any poor actors violating codes of conduct or acting out of self-interest, (2) For the removal of any member from a complaint of incompetence, (3) For qualifying candidates looking to run for a seat in any of the governing bodies. (4) Guaranteeing transparency of operations and intentions with the community, including oversight of fund distribution and evaluation of integrity of stakeholders. During the congressional term, the Transparency Commission is in charge of listening to, selecting complaints, and investigating them, from which only the TC can decide to either extend (the investigation), remove the member, or retain the member. Notably, the members of the TC themselves cannot file a complaint - they are tasked with investigating the complaints from the ecosystem after carefully evaluating their merit and legitimacy.

</aside>

**Membership: 7** members.

**Total Terms:** Max of 2 terms per individual.

**Tenure per Term:** 6 months.

**DAO Parameters:** `approval_threshold = 4, vote_duration = 5 days, min_vote_duration = 3 days, cooldown = 0`

**Appointment Eligibility Criteria:** Satisfying [OG SBT](https://near.org/neardigitalcollective.near/widget/NDCDocs_OneArticle?articleId=NDCV1-Safeguards&OGSBT&blockHeight=96512909&lastEditor=vikash.near) criteria.

**Removal Criteria:** Complaint and investigation from filing to TC followed by a motion to remove.

**Salaries**: (Based on contribution level)

1. Speakers and core contributors to each house will generally contribute more hours; some part-time and full-time resources may be required.
2. Hours vary based on representative availability, proposal volume, and process definition needs.

### Processes, Timelines & Key Stakeholders

The transparency commission meets to evaluate complaints, issue public opinions on such complaints, or issue notice of investigation. Every investigation may last as much as needed. Both the HoM and the CoA respect the final verdict of the TC; however, the CoA does possess the ability to clear or reinstate (to run once again) a dismissed individual.

As a matter of operations, the TC must investigate complaints against themselves.

Timeframe: To go over complaints and initiative investigations. Investigations limit = no limits.

| Process               | Description                                                                                            | Time Frame                                     | Key Stakeholders               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Motion to Investigate | Open an investigation to a complaint against an individual elected to an NDC body                      | As needed, duration of investigation as needed | TC, Member under investigation |
| Motion to Remove      | Removes a member from the post, leaving the post empty until the next election cycle                   | As needed                                      | TC, Member being removed       |
| Motion to Ban         | Removes a member from the post, and bans that member from serving in ANY Governance post in the future | As needed                                      | TC, Member being banned        |

### Minimum Threshold of Engagement for TC

| Activity            | Minimum Threshold | Frequency    | Implication of Failure | Notes                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Meeting Attendance  | 60%               | Per Month    | Subject to Removal     | Required to maintain active status |
| Voting on Proposals | 70%               | Per Proposal | Subject to Removal     | Required to maintain active status |

### Proposals

Members of the TC receive complaints and requests for investigation. Once a request is successfully considered, TC can make one of the following on chain proposals:

- **Motion to Remove / Revoke Powers**: A proposal to dismiss the member of their current role and responsibilities.
- **Motion to Remove and Ban**: A proposal to not only remove the member from their role but also ban them from future participation.
  - This is done manually by removing OG.
- **Motion to Retain**: A proposal to keep the member in their current role and end the investigation without further action

#### Appeal Process

The only appeal (for motion to remove and ban) process can be done through the CoA for a motion to Remove and Ban after two months and a strong majority vote or within the TC itself, pending another investigation.

### Investigation on a member of the TC

In the event a member of the TC is under investigation, they are ineligible to vote on the motion to investigate them or any subsequent motion related to it. Specifically, they cannot participate in votes that concern their own status. The TC defines the scope of votes that can concern a member. The complete list of proposals that can concern a member includes:

- Dismissal of the member under investigation
- Banning the member from future participation

However, until that member is either removed or retained, they may vote on any other issue. In the event of resignation prior to re-election, any grid-locked decision is taken as a rejection of the proposal.

## The Voting Body

### Quorums and Thresholds

- **Near Consent:** quorum=(7% of the voting body) + **simple majority**= `#yes > 50% * (#yes + #no + #spam)`.

The voting process is described in the Voting Body [contract documentation](https://github.com/near-ndc/voting-v1/tree/master/voting_body). In summary:

- Any Voting Body member can create a proposal.
- We need to introduce an anti-spam mechanism. The proposal flow introduces two queues: pre-vote queue (proposals that require more support or congress support before reaching the voting stage) and the active queue (verified proposals, ready for voting). See [creating proposals documentation](https://github.com/near-ndc/voting-v1/tree/master/voting_body#creating-proposals).
- Voting Body proposals are not finalized optimistically. Once in the voting stage, proposals are active until the end of the voting duration. This will give chance all members to express their opinion and provide more valuable result than simple approved / rejected (for example it also interesting to see how many people rejected a proposal even if it was eventually approved).
- In the current implementation, users can overwrite their votes. This decision was made following the elections feedback and motivated by the fact that new analysis about a proposal can come at later stage which can change mind of the voters who voted early on.

### Double Clicking On Dissolving a Governance Body

The threshold to reset an elected Governance Body - and dissolve it for new elections. For any of the three governing bodies, dissolve requires **Near Supermajority Consent**. If this vote is successful, new elections are held for the governing body, with the following week starting the candidacy period (See the governance framework for election timeframes!).

Note, this vote is done for only one governance body at a time - the voting body cannot dissolve all three houses at once. It must be three separate proposals and three separate votes.

### Changes To the Governance Framework

Changes to the governance framework can be made in two ways:

1. Via proposal and passage from the House of Merit, such that it is also NOT Vetoed by the Council of Advisors (in the usual passage).
2. Via the voting body, with **Near Supermajority Consent**. The proposal itself details out the full degree of changes made to the constitution and governance framework.

The changes are then implemented in the next Congress.

### Influence on the NDC

The voting body retains a significant influence over the NDC, ensuring its ability to overturn or shape its performance.
Moreover, Voting Body can be easily used as an authority over any DAO. `FunctionCall` type can call any external contract.
Moreover, we encourage other DAOs to Voting Body as a conflict resolution (could be used using `Text` proposal or aforementioned `FunctionCall` if related hook is available in the DAO).

## The Election Procedure

The election procedure establishes the precedent for how elections are conducted for all three governing bodies. It also pertains to the expansion of the governing bodies and alterations to the Gov Framework over time.

- _Election Eligibility Requirements:_ OG SBT.
- _Eligibility and Announcement:_ During the nomination period.
- _Election Timeframe:_ 2 weeks.
- _Onboarding Process:_ 1 week post-election
- _Conflicts of Interest:_ Community members looking to assume positions should disclose all their relevant affiliations, as well as any other potential conflicts of interest.

The ‘Election procedure’ can be divided into three separate sections:

- _The Candidate Process:_ How a person runs for a position and onboards to that position.
- _The Election Timer:_ When elections are conducted, the timeframes for voting, and the start of a new congress.
- _System Iteration Over Time:_ How these mechanics are able to be changed within the governance framework.

### The Candidate Process

To participate in any of the three governing bodies, a candidate must adhere to the following process:

1. the candidate cannot run for more than one seat in a given election; They must decide to run for either the HoM, CoA, or TC.
2. all candidates must announce their candidacy during the nomination period prior to the election. In the first congress, only OG SBT holders are eligible to run for congress.

Once a candidate has announced their candidacy, fulfilling the relevant OG SBT criteria, they appear on the election ballot voted on by the ecosystem during the election week. For all three institutions, all names are listed in random order, and the names with the most votes fill the open seats - this refers to a ranked-order voting structure, with the winners having the most votes from the field of candidates. In the first congress, there will be 29 open seats.

At the conclusion of the election, the winners are decided based upon majority vote.

1 week after the end of the election, the new candidates onboard to the governance platform and assume responsibilities based upon the seats they have been elected to.

### The Election Timer

The election timer refers to the timeframe for governance congresses and election cycles. Every election and every seat abides by the same election timer.

All candidates must announce their intention to run during the nomination period prior to the election. **The first congressional nomination window opens on July 20th and runs to September 7th.**

As the name suggests, the Election period is a two-week event from which any Verified/Unverfied Account can vote for any nominated candidate if they meet the bonding/or other requirements. **The first congressional election period starts on September 8th and runs until September 22nd (two weeks).**

At the close of the election period, a one-week window onboards the new congress and allows them to elect a speaker and orient themselves. This is known as the ‘setup week’ and is also when the members of the HoM can prepare to present the Setup Package. If changes are made in reference to the election process or timer, this takes place in the following election cycle.

At the end of T-Week the ‘Setup package’ is submitted, and the Congress officially begins. In the event that the Voting Body does not approve the ‘setup package,’ the new congress must submit another setup package for review before any other legislation can be passed or considered.

### System Iteration Over Time

Every new congress has the ability to alter the fundamental mechanics of the governing bodies in the passage of a new setup package. This means that any expansion to a governing, timer or term changes, or procedural change is done at the start of the new congress and implemented for the next election cycle - assuming approval by the CoA.

In addition, the governing bodies can, at any time, based on the feedback of the community and an approved referendum with a Super Majority Vote, be amended or reconstituted, known as a **_reset_** by an amendment to the Gov Framework. While the governing bodies are responsible for managing the community treasury, the voting body maintains the right to ensure the ecosystem continues its journey to decentralization by ensuring that evolving governance models are pragmatically implemented over time.

# NDC Personhood Voting v1

**Status: Draft**

## Abstract

We propose a powerful mechanism for human gated NDC v1 voting.
As stated in the constitution, NDC is the set of NEAR accounts representing the NEAR community (Near Digital Collective).

## Introduction

Personhood based voting requires a strong, Sybill resistant proof of personhood. There are many approaches how to achieve personhood verification:

1. Face verification: sophisticated algorithm which maps a face, assures that it is alive and computes unique ID based on the face map.
2. KYC (sumsub ...)
3. Community verification (BrightID, Proof of Humanity...)
4. Social media accounts

## Design

In Personhood based voting the voting power is equal among all NDC personhood accounts. This means that **each verified account has exactly 1 vote**.

### Personhood verification

We looked at various solutions. For v1, we want to be mindful of time and select a solid, Sybill resistant solution for human verification to release sooner than later.
After v1, our goal is to move towards multi-provider solution with stronger even stronger capabilities - the _I Am Human_ project.

We [analyzed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/111ZAJY8iqhUqo7oqF_RSaR1BX5dILtyh5E6-YkhW-tA/edit#) many solutions. Main criteria

- Sybill resistant: non human won't pass the test with a sufficiently high probability.
- Uniqueness check: same human can't generate two IDs
- Battle tested. The algorithm is heavily tested to only approve one account for the same human.
- Has sufficient market.
- Is inclusive.
- Low cost.

Throughout our analysis, we decided to use a FaceTech system. Other solutions either don't provide sufficient uniqueness guarantees (community networks, you can setup many accounts with KYC providers), require additional data collection requirements on our side (KYC providers) or are not sufficiently decentralized or battle tested.
For the Proof of Concept a [decision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ccPlRPvQCRsJTnoeaGYHrNYb27mjWK7aaUC4Aiw8f2U/edit?usp=sharing_eip_m&ts=63e6e810) has been drafted between GoodDollar and Verisoul and GoodDollar was selected.
NOTE: There is no NEAR native FaceTech provider (meaning that the provider issues a certificate directly on NEAR). Below we discuss an Oracle system responsible for issuing such a certificate in a form of SBT.

After PoC, in order to streamline the onboarding process, we followed the community recommendation and migrated to Fractal. Both Fractal and GoodDollar are using the same technology provider for Face Scan.

### NDC Personhood Criteria

- Account owner has been verified as unique, compared against all other verified users, using Fractal Face Scan.

### NEAR affiliation measures

Simple personhood might not be enough, if we require non trivial association with NEAR ecosystem for the NDC Governance.
We discussed additional criteria to measure association with the NEAR ecosystem, such us account activity history or stake history:

1. Have at least 1 NEAR staked.
1. Have staked at least 1 NEAR for at least 1 past month (complex requirement).
1. Have staked at least 1 NEAR for at least 1 month (very complex requirement).
1. Stakes 1 NEAR for voting (will be able to withdraw after voting finishes).
1. Proven history of NEAR activity measured by number of transactions and time.

We restrain from including them in v1 because it will significantly complexify the system (will require to implement trustless snapshot an proof verification mechanism).

### Oracle

To bridge FaceTech identity to NEAR we need an oracle. I will act as a middleware between the Fractal system and NEAR blockchain. Requirements:

- decentralized verification process
- assuring ownership of the Fractal face verified account and NEAR account.

Privacy concerns:

- Fractal doesn't provide a face metadata to assure privacy.
- We should make sure that: verifier doesn't link Fractal identities to fake or wrong accounts AND doesn't link non existing Fractal identities to NEAR accounts.

### Design and Implementation

https://github.com/near-ndc/i-am-human/blob/master/contracts/oracle/README.md

### Oracle Risks

FaceTech based solution is seen as independent solution, but it's not decentralized. In case of GoodDollar we have the following risks

- reliance on a single personhood verifier
- verifier risks: censorship, halting the system, a single point of failure.
- additional system variables
- non trivial NDC Approved Account requirements
- adding Staked NEAR as a requirement will require implementation of stake weighted voting framework.

## Consequences

Positive

- more democratic
- reduces whale impact
- using a tested, sybill resistant solution

Neutral

- good enough for start, with open, compatible path towards for next versions

Negative

- more centralized (requires a trust in the personhood proof provider)
- more complex (more variables and more moving elements)
- non trivial NDC Approved Account

## Further Notes

This is only the first step. We are planning to improve and decentralize the NEAR human protocol in the future versions. We already outlined the general ideas in `i-am-human`:

- [I Am Human early design](https://hackmd.io/ZvgUeoF4SMGM4InswH0Dsg)
- [Demystifying i-am-human](https://github.com/near-ndc/i-am-human-dapp)
- [WIP: Design](https://hackmd.io/@Kazander/ryHHniFqi)

# Stake Weighted Voting

**Status: Draft**

Each account has a variable voting power determined by the amount of NEAR staked at the block height specified in a proposal. Instead of one account = one vote credit, which is gameable in pseudo anonymous world of blockchains (accounts are easy to forge, a proper solution will require human gating mechanism, which is part of the v2 Framework), each account will cast power vote.

The system is being built collaboratively by Proximity Labs and the GWG.

For v1, the Voting Body is set of accounts staking NEAR (delegated to validators), except staking pools and other identified smart contracts and entities who are known to aggregate stake.

- 1 Staked NEAR = 1 vote;

### Stake-Weighted Thresholds

- **NEAR Quorum Requirement** means, in respect of a vote, that votes are cast by the holders of at least `5%` of all Staked NEAR on the NEAR Blockchain.
- **NEAR Big Quorum Requirement** means, in respect of a vote, that votes are cast by the holders of at least `8%` of all Staked NEAR on the NEAR Blockchain.
- **NEAR Consent** means the approval of a proposal (including a Community Proposal), matter and/or decision by the NEAR Community, where a vote of the NEAR Community in relation to that proposal (including a Community Proposal), matter and/or decision takes place and both of the following apply in respect of that vote:
  - the NEAR Quorum Requirement is met;
  - the number of "yes" votes cast is more than 50% of the sum of "yes" and "no" votes: `#yes_votes > #no_votes` (we don't consider abstain votes for the threshold).
- **NEAR Supermajority Consent** -- similar to Supermajority Consent:
  - the NEAR Big Quorum Requirement is met;
  - the number of "yes" votes cast is more than 60% of the sum of "yes" and "no" votes: `#yes_votes > 60% × (#yes_votes + #no_votes)` (we don't consider abstain votes for the threshold).

### Personhood Voting with Stake Weight Quorum Thresholds

- **NDC Approved Account**: has the same meaning as in _Proof-of-Personhood Voting_ above.
- **NEAR Quorum Power** is the sum of cubic root of the staked NEAR of each voting NDC approved account that had staked at the time pointed the proposal (resolved as a snapshot).

        struct Proposal {
            // ...
            stakeTree: StakeSnapshot
        }

        quorum_power(p: Proposal, voters: []AccuntId) -> u128 {
            voters
                .map(|a| -> pow(p.stakeTree.accountStake(a)), 1/3) // TODO: need to make it deterministic
                .sum()
        }

- **NEAR Quorum Requirement** means, in respect of a vote, that the Quorum Power must be greater than the Quorum Threshold which is defined as the cubic root of (5% of all staked NEAR) plus 2000.
- **NEAR Big Quorum Requirement** means, in respect of a vote, that the Quorum Power must be greater than the Quorum Threshold which is defined as the cubic root of (8% of all staked NEAR) plus 2000.
- **NEAR Supermajority Consent** and **NEAR Consent** have the same meaning as in _Proof-of-Personhood Voting_ above.
