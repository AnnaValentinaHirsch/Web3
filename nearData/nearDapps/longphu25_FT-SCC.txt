Fungible Token (FT)
===================

Example implementation of a [Fungible Token] contract which uses [near-contract-standards] and [simulation] tests. This is a contract-only example.

**Note**: this README is specific to Windows and this example. For development on OS X or Linux, please see [README.md](README.md).

  [Fungible Token]: https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/FungibleTokenCore.html
  [near-contract-standards]: https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/near-contract-standards
  [simulation]: https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/near-sdk-sim

Prerequisites
=============

If you're using Gitpod, you can skip this step.

1. Make sure Rust is installed per the prerequisites in [`near-sdk-rs`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs#pre-requisites)
2. Ensure `near-cli` is installed by running `near --version`. If not installed, install with: `npm install --global near-cli`

## Building

To build run in CMD:
```bash
build.bat
```

Using this contract
===================

This smart contract will get deployed to your NEAR account. For this example, please create a new NEAR account. Because NEAR allows the ability to upgrade contracts on the same account, initialization functions must be cleared. If you'd like to run this example on a NEAR account that has had prior contracts deployed, please use the `near-cli` command `near delete`, and then recreate it in Wallet. To create (or recreate) an account, please follow the directions on [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.near.org/).

Switch to `mainnet`. You can skip this step to use `testnet` as a default network.

    set NEAR_ENV=mainnet

In the project root, log in to your newly created account  with `near-cli` by following the instructions after this command:

    near login

To make this tutorial easier to copy/paste, we're going to set an environment variable for your account id. In the below command, replace `MY_ACCOUNT_NAME` with the account name you just logged in with, including the `.near`:

    set ID=MY_ACCOUNT_NAME

You can tell if the environment variable is set correctly if your command line prints the account name after this command:

    echo %ID%

Now we can deploy the compiled contract in this example to your account:

    near deploy --wasmFile res/fungible_token.wasm --accountId %ID%

FT contract should be initialized before usage. You can read more about metadata at ['nomicon.io'](https://nomicon.io/Standards/FungibleToken/Metadata.html#reference-level-explanation). Modify the parameters and create a token:

    near call %ID% new "{\"owner_id\": \""%ID%"\", \"total_supply\": \"1000000000000000\", \"metadata\": { \"spec\": \"ft-1.0.0\", \"name\": \"Example Token Name\", \"symbol\": \"EXLT\", \"decimals\": 8 }}" --accountId %ID%

Get metadata:

    near view %ID% ft_metadata

Transfer Example
---------------

Let's set up an account to transfer some tokens to. These account will be a sub-account of the NEAR account you logged in with.

    near create-account bob.%ID% --masterAccount %ID% --initialBalance 1

Add storage deposit for Bob's account:

    near call %ID% storage_deposit '' --accountId bob.%ID% --amount 0.00125

Check balance of Bob's account, it should be `0` for now:

    near view %ID% ft_balance_of "{\"account_id\": \""bob.%ID%"\"}"

Transfer tokens to Bob from the contract that minted these fungible tokens, exactly 1 yoctoNEAR of deposit should be attached:

    near call %ID% ft_transfer "{\"receiver_id\": \""bob.%ID%"\", \"amount\": \"19\"}" --accountId %ID% --amount 0.000000000000000000000001

Check the balance of Bob again with the command from before and it will now return `19`.

## Testing

As with many Rust libraries and contracts, there are tests in the main fungible token implementation at `ft/src/lib.rs`.

Additionally, this project has [simulation] tests in `tests/sim`. Simulation tests allow testing cross-contract calls, which is crucial to ensuring that the `ft_transfer_call` function works properly. These simulation tests are the reason this project has the file structure it does. Note that the root project has a `Cargo.toml` which sets it up as a workspace. `ft` and `test-contract-defi` are both small & focused contract projects, the latter only existing for simulation tests. The root project imports `near-sdk-sim` and tests interaction between these contracts.

You can run all these tests with one command:

```bash
cargo test
```

If you want to run only simulation tests, you can use `cargo test simulate`, since all the simulation tests include "simulate" in their names.

## Notes

 - The maximum balance value is limited by U128 (`2**128 - 1`).
 - JSON calls should pass U128 as a base-10 string. E.g. "100".
 - This does not include escrow functionality, as `ft_transfer_call` provides a superior approach. An escrow system can, of course, be added as a separate contract or additional functionality within this contract.

## No AssemblyScript?

[near-contract-standards] is currently Rust-only. We strongly suggest using this library to create your own Fungible Token contract to ensure it works as expected.

Someday NEAR core or community contributors may provide a similar library for AssemblyScript, at which point this example will be updated to include both a Rust and AssemblyScript version.

## Contributing

When making changes to the files in `ft` or `test-contract-defi`, remember to use `./build.sh` to compile all contracts and copy the output to the `res` folder. If you forget this, **the simulation tests will not use the latest versions**.

Fungible Token (FT)
===================

Example implementation of a [Fungible Token] contract which uses [near-contract-standards] and [simulation] tests. This is a contract-only example.

  [Fungible Token]: https://nomicon.io/Standards/FungibleToken/Core
  [near-contract-standards]: https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/near-contract-standards
  [simulation]: https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/near-sdk-sim

Prerequisites
=============

If you're using Gitpod, you can skip this step.

1. Make sure Rust is installed per the prerequisites in [`near-sdk-rs`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs#pre-requisites)
2. Ensure `near-cli` is installed by running `near --version`. If not installed, install with: `npm install -g near-cli`

## Building

To build run:
```bash
./build.sh
```

Using this contract
===================

### Quickest deploy

You can build and deploy this smart contract to a development account. [Dev Accounts](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/account#dev-accounts) are auto-generated accounts to assist in developing and testing smart contracts. Please see the [Standard deploy](#standard-deploy) section for creating a more personalized account to deploy to.

```bash
near dev-deploy --wasmFile res/fungible_token.wasm --helperUrl https://near-contract-helper.onrender.com
```

Behind the scenes, this is creating an account and deploying a contract to it. On the console, notice a message like:

>Done deploying to dev-1234567890123

In this instance, the account is `dev-1234567890123`. A file has been created containing a key pair to
the account, located at `neardev/dev-account`. To make the next few steps easier, we're going to set an
environment variable containing this development account id and use that when copy/pasting commands.
Run this command to the environment variable:

```bash
source neardev/dev-account.env
```

You can tell if the environment variable is set correctly if your command line prints the account name after this command:
```bash
echo $CONTRACT_NAME
```

The next command will initialize the contract using the `new` method:

```bash
near call $CONTRACT_NAME new '{"owner_id": "'$CONTRACT_NAME'", "total_supply": "1000000000000000", "metadata": { "spec": "ft-1.0.0", "name": "Example Token Name", "symbol": "EXLT", "decimals": 8 }}' --accountId $CONTRACT_NAME
```

To get the fungible token metadata:

```bash
near view $CONTRACT_NAME ft_metadata
```

### Standard deploy

This smart contract will get deployed to your NEAR account. For this example, please create a new NEAR account. Because NEAR allows the ability to upgrade contracts on the same account, initialization functions must be cleared. If you'd like to run this example on a NEAR account that has had prior contracts deployed, please use the `near-cli` command `near delete`, and then recreate it in Wallet. To create (or recreate) an account, please follow the directions on [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.near.org/).

Switch to `mainnet`. You can skip this step to use `testnet` as a default network.

    export NEAR_ENV=mainnet

In the project root, log in to your newly created account  with `near-cli` by following the instructions after this command:

    near login

To make this tutorial easier to copy/paste, we're going to set an environment variable for your account id. In the below command, replace `MY_ACCOUNT_NAME` with the account name you just logged in with, including the `.near`:

    ID=MY_ACCOUNT_NAME

You can tell if the environment variable is set correctly if your command line prints the account name after this command:

    echo $ID

Now we can deploy the compiled contract in this example to your account:

    near deploy --wasmFile res/fungible_token.wasm --accountId $ID

FT contract should be initialized before usage. You can read more about metadata at ['nomicon.io'](https://nomicon.io/Standards/FungibleToken/Metadata.html#reference-level-explanation). Modify the parameters and create a token:

    near call $ID new '{"owner_id": "'$ID'", "total_supply": "1000000000000000", "metadata": { "spec": "ft-1.0.0", "name": "Example Token Name", "symbol": "EXLT", "decimals": 8 }}' --accountId $ID

Get metadata:

    near view $ID ft_metadata

Transfer Example
---------------

Let's set up an account to transfer some tokens to. These account will be a sub-account of the NEAR account you logged in with.

    near create-account bob.$ID --masterAccount $ID --initialBalance 1

Add storage deposit for Bob's account:

    near call $ID storage_deposit '' --accountId bob.$ID --amount 0.00125

Check balance of Bob's account, it should be `0` for now:

    near view $ID ft_balance_of '{"account_id": "'bob.$ID'"}'

Transfer tokens to Bob from the contract that minted these fungible tokens, exactly 1 yoctoNEAR of deposit should be attached:

    near call $ID ft_transfer '{"receiver_id": "'bob.$ID'", "amount": "19"}' --accountId $ID --amount 0.000000000000000000000001

Check the balance of Bob again with the command from before and it will now return `19`.

Fungible Token implementation with JSON serialization.
NOTES:
  - The maximum balance value is limited by U128 (2**128 - 1).
  - JSON calls should pass U128 as a base-10 string. E.g. "100".
  - The contract optimizes the inner trie structure by hashing account IDs. It will prevent some
    abuse of deep tries. Shouldn't be an issue, once NEAR clients implement full hashing of keys.
  - The contract tracks the change in storage before and after the call. If the storage increases,
    the contract requires the caller of the contract to attach enough deposit to the function call
    to cover the storage cost.
    This is done to prevent a denial of service attack on the contract by taking all available storage.
    If the storage decreases, the contract will issue a refund for the cost of the released storage.
    The unused tokens from the attached deposit are also refunded, so it's safe to
    attach more deposit than required.
  - To prevent the deployed contract from being modified or deleted, it should not have any access
    keys on its account.
